A breath of melancholy made itself felt
A brilliant and paradoxical talker
A broad, complacent, admiring imbecility breathed from his nose and lips
A burlesque feint of evading a blow

A certain catholicity of taste        
A certain implication of admiring confidence
A charming air of vigor and vitality

A childish belief in his own impeccability
A civilizing agency of conspicuous value
A cleanness and probity of life   
A cloud in the west like a pall creeps upward
A cloud like a flag from the sky
A cluster of stars hangs like fruit in the tree
A cold, hard, frosty penuriousness was his prevalent characteristic
A commendable restraint
A compassion perfectly angelic
A condescending and patronizing spirit
A confused and troublesome time
A confused mass of impressions, like an old rubbish-heap
A conscientious anxiety to do the right thing
A conspicuous and crowning service
A constant source of surprise and delight
A constant stream of rhythmic memories
A contemptible species of mockery
A convenient makeshift
A copious torrent of pleasantry
A course of arrogant obstinacy
A covertly triumphant voice
A creature of the most delicate and rapid responses
A crop of disappointments
A crumb of consolation

A face as pale as wax
A face singularly acute and intelligent
A face tempered like steel
A fact of vast moment
A faint accent of reproach
A faint sense of compunction moved her
A faint tremor of amusement was on his lips
A faint, transient, wistful smile lightened her brooding face
A faintly quizzical look came into his incisive stare

A fatal moral hollowness
A fatigued, faded, lusterless air, as of a caged creature
A fawn-colored sea streaked here and there with tints of deepest orange
A feeling of lofty remoteness
A feminine excess of inconsequence
A fever of enthusiasm
A few pens parched by long disuse
A few tears came to soften her seared vision
A few words will suffice to answer
A fiery exclamation of wrath and disdain
A figure full of decision and dignity
A figure like a carving on a spire
A final and irrevocable settlement
A firm and balanced manhood
A firmness tempered by the most scrupulous courtesy
A first faint trace of irritation
A fitful boy full of dreams and hopes
A fitting interval for penitence
A flame of scarlet crept in a swift diagonal across his cheeks
A fleeting and furtive air of triumph
A flippant rejoinder
A flood of external impressions
A flood of pride rose in him
A flourish of rhetoric
A fluttering as of blind bewildered moths
A foreboding of some destined change
A fortuitous series of happy thoughts
A frigid touch of the hand
A fugitive intangible charm
A fund of curious information
A further objection is
A furtive groping after knowledge
A gambler's desperate chance
A gay exuberance of ambition
A generation of men lavishly endowed with genius
A gentle sarcasm ruffled her anger
A ghastly mixture of defiance and conceit
A ghastly whiteness overspread the cheek
A giant galleon overhead, looked like some misty monster of the deep
A glacial pang of pain like
A glance of extraordinary meaning
A glance that flitted like a bird
A glaring example of rapacity            
A glassy expression of inattention
A glassy stare of deprecating horror

A half-uneasy, half-laughing compunction
A hand icily cold and clammy as death
A happy and compensating experience
A harassing anxiety of sorrow
A harvest of barren regrets
A haughty self-assertion of equality
A haunting and horrible sense of insecurity
A heart from which noble sentiments sprang like sparks from an anvil

A large, rich, copious human endowment
A late star lingered, remotely burning
A laudable stimulus
A laugh of jovial significance
A law of retributive justice
A less revolutionary innovation
A life as common and brown and bare as the box of earth in the window there
A life of studious contemplation
A life, a Presence, like the air
A light of unwonted pleasure in her eyes         
A light wind outside the lattice swayed a branch of roses to and fro,
A lightning-phrase, as if shot from the quiver of infallible wisdom
A limpidity and lucidity of style
A lingering tinge of admiration
A list of our unread books torments some of us like a list of murders
A little breeze ran through the corn like a swift serpent
A little indulgence may be due to those
A little jaded by gastronomical exertions
A little weed-clogged ship, gray as a ghost
A lively sense of what is dishonorable
A long accumulating store of discontent and unrest
A long slit of daylight like a pointing finger
A long tangle of unavoidable detail

A majority of us believe
A man in my situation has
A man of imperious will

A monstrous travesty
A mood of hard skepticism
A more plausible objection is found
A more than ordinary share of baseness and depravity

A mouth of inflexible decision
A multitude of groundless alarms
A murderous tenacity about trifles
A murmur of complacency
A mysterious and an intractable pestilence
A mysterious and inscrutable power

A name which sounds even now like the call of a trumpet
A nameless sadness which is always born of moonlight
A narrow and superficial survey
A nature somewhat frivolous and irresolute

A profound and rather irritating egotist by nature
A profusion of compliments
A proof of this is
A prop for my faint heart
A propitious sky, marbled with pearly white
A proposition inherently vicious
A protest wavered on her lip
A puerile illusion                 
A puissant and brilliant family             
A purpose as the steady flame
A queer, uncomfortable perplexity began to invade her
A quenchless thirst for expression
A question deep almost as the mystery of life
A quibbling mouth that snapped at verbal errors
A quick flame leaped in his eyes

A sense of indescribable reverence
A sense of infinite peace brooded over the place
A sense of meditative content
A sense of repression was upon her
A sentiment of distrust in its worth had crept into her thoughts
A series of brief and irritating hopes
A servile mind can never know
A settled conviction of success
A shadow of melancholy touched her lithe fancies,
A sharp difference of opinion
A sharp pang of regretful surprise
A sheaf of letters
A shimmer of golden sun shaking through the trees
A shiver of apprehension crisped her skin
A short time since
A shrewd eye to the main chance
A shuffling compromise between defiance and prostration
A sigh of large contentment
A sight for the angels to weep over
A signal deed of justice
A silver moon, like a new-stamped coin, rode triumphant in the sky
A skeptical suspension of judgment
A skepticism which prompted rebellion
A slight and superficial tribute
A slight movement of incredulous dissent
A slow thought that crept like a cold worm through all his brain
A slowly subsiding frenzy

A soft and purple mist like a vaporous amethyst
A soft haze, like a fairy dream, is floating over wood and stream
A soft insidious plea
A soft intonation of profound sorrow
A soft suspicion of ulterior motives
A solemn glee possessed my mind
A solemn gray expanse that lost itself far away in the gray of the sea
A solemn utterance of destiny
A somber and breathless calm hung over the deepening eve
A somewhat complicated and abstruse calculation
A somewhat melancholy indolence
A somewhat sharp and incisive voice
A sonorous voice bade me enter
A soothing and quieting touch was gently laid upon her soul
A sordid and detestable motive
A sort of eager, almost appealing amiability

A sort of stunned incredulity
A soul as white as heaven
A sound like the throb of a bell
A soundless breeze that was little more than a whisper
A source of unfailing delight and wonder

A species of moral usurpation
A specific answer can be given

A state of sullen self-absorption
A state of urgent necessity
A steady babble of talk and laughter
A step was at her heels
A stern decree of fate
A stern foe of snobbishness
A stifling sensation of pain and suspense

A sweet, quiet, sacred, stately seclusion
A swift knowledge came to her
A swift unformulated fear
A swiftly unrolling panorama of dreams
A synonym for retrogression
A tangle of ugly words
A taunting accusation of falsehood
A tedious and needless drudgery
A telegram is enclosed for your use, as this matter is urgent
A temper which brooked no resistance
A temporary expedient
A tender tone of remonstrance
A theme of endless meditation
A thin shrill voice like the cry of an expiring mouse
A thing of as frail enchantment as the gleam of stars upon snow
A thing of moods and moments
A thoroughly sincere and unaffected effort
A thought occurred to me
A thousand evanescent memories of happy days
A thousand hopes for your success
A thousand mangled delusions
A thousand unutterable fears bore irresistible despotism over her thoughts
A time of disillusion followed
A tiny stream meandering amiably
A tissue of dull excuses
A tone of arduous admiration
A tone of exaggerated solicitude
A torn and tumultuous sky
A total impression ineffable and indescribable
A touch of exquisite pathos
A trace of obvious sarcasm
A tragic futility
A transcript of the common conscience
A treacherous throb of her voice
A trifle prim and puritanic
A true similitude of what befalls many men and women
A truth begirt with fire
A tumult of vehement feeling
A tumultuous rush of sensations
A twinge of embarrassment
A unique and overwhelming charm
A vague and wistful melancholy
A vague aversion
A vague thought, as elusive as the smell of a primrose
A vanishing loveliness as tender as the flush of the rose leaf
A variety of conflicting and profound emotions
A variety of enfeebling amendments
A vast multitude of facts
A vast sweet silence crept through the trees
A vastly extended vision of opportunity
A vehement and direct attack
A veritable spring-cleaning of the soul
A very elusive and delicate thought
A very formidable problem
A very practised and somewhat fastidious critic
A vigilant reserve
A violent and base calumniator
A violent and mendacious tongue              
A vivid and arresting presentation
A voice as low as the sea
A voice of matchless compass and eloquence
A voice soft and sweet as a tune that one knows
A waking dream overshadowed her
A warmth of seemingly generous indignations
A wealth of resource that seemed inexhaustible
A weird world of morbid horrors
A welcome release from besetting difficulties
A well-bred mixture of boldness and courtesy
A white bird floats there, like a drifting leaf
A whole catalog of disastrous blunders
A whole whirlpool of various emotions
A wild vivacity was in her face and manner
A wile of the devil's       
A wind strayed through the gardens
A withering sensation of ineffable boredom
A wordless farewell
Able men have reasoned out
Abounding bodily vigor
Above all things, let us not forget
Above and beyond and before all else
Absolutely true it is
Absolutely vulgarized by too perpetual a parroting
Absorbed in a stream of thoughts and reminiscences
Absorbed in the scent and murmur of the night
Absurd and inconsequential career
Abundant and congenial employment
Abundant reason is there
Accept my best wishes
Accept our thanks for your recent remittance
Accidental rather than intentional
Accidents which perpetually deflect our vagrant attention
Accordingly by reason of this circumstance
Accustomed to ascribe to chance
Acknowledging the receipt of your recent inquiry
Acquired sentiments of propriety
Across the gulf of years
Activities of the discursive intellect
Actuated by an unduly anxious desire
Acute sensibility coupled with quickness of intellect
Add this instance to
Adhere too tenaciously to forms and modes
Administering a little deft though veiled castigation
Admirable mastery of technique
Admit the soft impeachment
Admitted with a childlike cheerfulness
Advance by leaps and bounds
Advancing to dignity and honor
Adventitious aids to memory
Affectation and superfluous ornament
Affected an ironic incredulity
Affecting a tone of gayety
After a careful study of all the evidence
After a first moment of reluctance
After an eternity of resolutions, doubts, and indecisions
After examination we can confidently say
After full deliberation
After reminding the hearer
After this it remains only to say
After very carefully considering
Again thanking you for the inquiry
Again, I ask the gentleman
Again, can we doubt
Again, in this view
Again, it is quite clear that
Again, it is urged
Again, let us compare
Again, very numerous are the cases
Again, we have abundant instances
Against a sky as clear as sapphire
Against all this concurring testimony
Age, like winter weather
Aggravated to an unspeakable degree
Aghast at his own helplessness
Agile as a leopard
Agitated and enthralled by day-dreams
Agitated and perplexed by a dozen cross-currents of conflicting tendency
Agitated like a storm-tossed ship
Agitated with violent and contending emotions
Agreeable and humanizing intercourse
Agreeable to our conversation
Aided by strong mental endowments
Air like wine
Airy swiftness of treatment
Alien paths and irrelevant junketings
Alien to the purpose
All I ask is
All around them like a forest swept the deep and
All confess this to be true
All embrowned and mossed with age
All her gift of serene immobility brought into play
All hope of discreet reticence was ripped to shreds
All like an icicle it seemed, so tapering and cold
All my life broke up, like some great river's ice at touch of spring
All of us know
All silent as the sheeted dead
All sorts of petty tyrannies
All sounds were lost in the whistle of air humming by
All that I will say now
All that is conjecture
All that's beautiful drifts away like the waters
All the facts which support this
All the lesser lights paled into insignificance
All the magic of youth and joy of life was there
All the place is peopled with sweet airs
All the resources of a burnished rhetoric
All the signs of the time indicate
All the sky was mother-of-pearl and tender
All the unknown of the night and of the universe was pressing upon him
All the world lay stretched before him like the open palm of his hand
All the world was flooded with a soft golden light
All these things you know
All this being considered
All this is historical fact
All this is very well
All this suggests
All this we take for granted
All unconscious as a flower
All was a vague jumble of chaotic impressions
All was incomprehensible
All was instinctive and spontaneous
Allied by taste and circumstances
Allied with a marked imperiousness   
Allow me for a moment to turn to
Allow me to congratulate you
Allow me to tell a story
Almost incredible obtuseness
Alone, like a storm-tossed wreck, on this night of the glad New Year
Aloof from the motley throng
Altho I say it to myself
Altogether monstrous and unnatural
Always observant and discriminating
Am I mistaken in this
Amaze and confound the imagination
Amazing as it may seem
Ambition shivered into fragments
Amiable and indulgent hostess
Amid distress and humiliation
Amid many and pressing avocations
Amid the direful calamities of the time
Amid the homeliest details of daily life
Amid the rush and roar of life
Among many examples
Among the distinguished guests who honor
Among the problems that confront us
Ample scope for the exercise of his astonishing gifts
An abandoned and exaggerated grief
An accidental encounter
An act of folly amounting to wickedness
An acute note of distress in her voice
An addressed envelope is enclosed for your convenience
An afternoon of painfully constrained behavior
An agreeable image of serene dignity
An agreeably grave vacuity
An air half quizzical and half deferential
An air of affected civility
An air of artificial constraint
An air of being meticulously explicit
An air of inimitable, scrutinizing, superb impertinence
An air of round-eyed profundity
An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all
An air of uncanny familiarity
An air which was distinctly critical
An alarmed sense of strange responsibilities
An almost excessive exactness
An almost pathetic appearance of ephemeral fragility
An almost riotous prodigality of energy
An almost sepulchral regularity and seclusion
An ample and imposing structure
An answer to this is now ready
An answering glow of gratitude
An antagonist worth her steel
An anxiety hung like a dark impenetrable cloud
An apostle of unworldly ardor
An appreciable menace
An ardent and gifted youth
An ardent face out-looking like a star
An argument has often been put forward
An arid dictum
An artful and malignant enemy
An artful stroke of policy
An assumption entirely gratuitous
An assumption of hostile intent
An assumption which proved erroneous
An assurance of good-nature that forestalled hostility
An atmosphere of extraordinary languor    
An atmosphere of sunny gaiety
An atmosphere thick with flattery and toadyism
An attack of peculiar virulence and malevolence
An attitude of passive impartiality
An audacious challenge of ridicule
An authoritative and conclusive inquiry
An avidity that bespoke at once the restlessness,   
An awe crept over me
An eager and thirsty ear
An early reply will greatly oblige
An easy prey to the powers of folly
An ecstasy which suddenly overwhelms your mind like
An effusive air of welcome
An egregious assumption       
An elaborate assumption of indifference
An endless field for discussion
An enervating and emasculating form of indulgence
An ennobling and invigorating influence
An entirely negligible quantity
An envious wind crept by like an unwelcome thought
An equal degree of well-bred worldly cynicism
An erect, martial, majestic, and imposing personage
An essentially grotesque and commonplace thing
An eternal and imperishable example
An eternity of silence oppressed him
An exalted and chimerical sense of honor
An example or two will illustrate
An excess of unadulterated praise
An excessive refinement of feeling
An expression at once confident and appealing
An expression of mildly humorous surprise
An expression of rare and inexplicable personal energy
An exquisite perception of things beautiful and rare
An extensive and populous country
An habitual steadiness and coolness of reflection
An honest and unquestioning pride
An iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart
An icy indifference
An ideal as sublime and comprehensive as the horizon
An idle and unworthy action
An ignoring eye
An ill-assorted vocabulary
An immeasurable advantage
An imminent and overmastering peril
An immortal spirit dwelt in that frail body, like a bird in an outworn cage
An impenetrable screen of foliage
An impersonal and slightly ironic interest
An imperturbable demeanor and steadiness of mind
An impervious beckoning motion
An implacable foe
An impudent trick as hackneyed as conjuring rabbits out of a hat
An inarticulate echo of his longing
An inborn and irresistible impulse
An incongruous spectacle
An increased gentleness of aspect
An incredible mental agility
An incursion of the loud, the vulgar and meretricious
An indefinable resemblance to a goat
An indefinable taint of priggishness
An indescribable frankness and simplicity of character
An indescribably touching incident
An indolent surrender to mere sensuous experience
An indomitable and unselfish soul
An ineradicable love of fun and mystification
An inevitable factor of human conduct
An inexhaustible copiousness and readiness of speech
An inexplicable and uselessly cruel caprice of fate
An inexpressible fervor of serenity
An ingratiating, awkward and, wistful grace
An insatiable appetite for trifles
An insatiable voracity
An inscrutable mystery
An inspired ray was in his eyes
An instant she stared unbelievingly
An intense and insatiable hunger for light and truth
An intense travail of mind
An intentional breach of politeness
An interchange of civilities
An intolerable deal of guesswork
An involuntary gesture of remonstrance
An irrelevant bit of magniloquence
An irrepressible and impassioned hopefulness
An irritating and dangerous treatment
An isle of Paradise, fair as a gem
An itching propensity for argument
An object of indestructible interest
An obnoxious member of society
An obscure thrill of alarm
An odd little air of penitent self-depreciation
An old nodding negress whose sable head shined in the sun
An ominous lull and silence
An omnibus across the bridge crawls like a yellow butterfly
An open and violent rupture
An open wit and recklessness of bearing
An opinion has now become established
An oppressive sense of strange sweet odor
An optimistic after-dinner mood
An outburst of impassioned eloquence
An overburdening sense of the inexpressible
An unaccountable feeling of antipathy
An unbecoming vehemence
An uncomfortable premonition of fear
An undefined sadness seemed to have fallen about her like a cloud
An undisciplined state of feeling
An unerring sense of humor
An unfailing sweetness and unerring perception
An unfortunate comparison, don't you think?
An unknown world, wild as primeval chaos
An unparalleled and almost miraculous growth
An unparalleled atrocity
An unpatriotic and ignoble act
An unpleasant and heavy sensation sat at his heart
An unpleasing strain, like the vibration of a rope drawn out too fast
An unreasoning form of coercion
An unredeemed dreariness of thought
An unsuspected moral obtuseness
An utter depression of soul
An utterly vile and detestable spirit
And Dusk, with breast as of a dove, brooded
And I am bound to say
And I beg of you
And I call on you
And I might say this
And I refuse assent
And I rejoice to know
And I say, it were better for you
And I should in like manner repudiate
And I speak with reverence
And I submit to you
And I trust that you will consider
And I will make a practical suggestion
And I will tell you why
And I would, moreover submit
And a pinnace like a flutter'd bird came flying from afar
And a tear like silver, glistened in the corner of her eye
And again, it is said
And again, it is to be presumed
And all our thoughts ran into tears like sunshine into rain
And at first the road comes moving toward me, like a bride waving palms
And coming nearer to our own day
And day peers forth with her blank eyes
And did a man try to persuade me
And do you really think
And even if it were so?
And everybody here knows
And eyes as bright as the day
And fell as cold as a lump of clay
And for myself, as I said
And further, all that I have said
And hence the well-known doctrine
And her cheek was like a rose
And here I am led to observe
And here I come to the closing evidence
And here I have an opportunity
And here I reproach
And here I wish you to observe
And here again, when I speak
And here allow me to call your attention
And here let me define my position
And here let me give my explanation
And here let us recall to mind
And here were forests ancient as the hills
And how am I to thank you?
And how is it possible to imagine
And if I know anything of my countrymen
And if I may presume to speak
And if I take another instance
And if a man could anywhere be found
And if any of you should question
And if this be true
And if you come to a decision
And if you think it your duty
And in conclusion
And in like manner
And in order to see this
And in the end, what are you going to make of it?
And in thus speaking, I am not denying
And is not this lamentable
And is there not a presumption
And it happens
And it is certainly true
And it is doubtful if
And it is not difficult to see
And it is not plain
And it is one of the evidences
And it is precisely in this
And it is strikingly suggested to us
And it is undeniable, I say
And it is well that this should be so
And last of all
And lest anyone should marvel
And let it be observed
And lo! and behold
And many a fountain, rivulet, and pond,
And melting like the stars in June
And more than this
And next I would ask
And night, as welcome as a friend
And now I address myself to my task
And now I beg that I may be permitted
And now I go back to the statement
And now I have completed my review
And now I have said enough to explain
And now I must touch upon one point
And now allow me to call attention
And now behold a mystery
And now consider
And now having discussed
And now if I may take for granted
And now it would be very pleasant for me
And now observe how
And now supposing this point to be settled
And now that I have mentioned
And now the chief points of it
And now the question is asked me
And now, sir, what I had first to say
And now, to close, let me give you
And now, to what purpose do I mention
And of this I am perfectly certain
And quite as difficult is it to create
And right here lies the cause
And silence like a poultice comes to heal the blows of sound
And so I am reminded of a story
And so I leave these words with you
And so I may point out
And so I might recount to you
And so in the present case
And so on
And so through all phases
And so, again, as regard
And so, in the other cases, I have named
And so, upon every hand
And sometimes it will be difficult
And spangled o'er with twinkling points, like stars
And that gave another distorted view
And the like
And the reason is very obvious
And the same holds good
And the smile she softly uses fills the silence like a speech
And then I may be reminded
And then again
And then hastily to conclude
And then there is another thought
And then when it is said
And there are reasons why
And there is also this view
And therefore am I truly glad
And therefore it is not unfrequently quoted
And therefore it is not without regret
And this brings me to the last thing
And this is really the sense
And this leads me to say a word
And thus consistently
And thus it is conceivable
And thus it seems to me
And thus we are led on then to further question
And to all this must be added
And to return to the topic
And to this conclusion you must come
And unquestionably
And we are brought to the same conclusion
And what do you suppose will be
And what is all this pother about?     
And when I have shown to you
And when I recall that event
And when we pass beyond the bounds of
And where, let me ask
And why should I insist
And will you still insist
And with these thoughts come others
And yet I can not but reflect
And yet I feel justified in believing
And yet I think we all feel
And yet let me say to you
And yet one more quotation
And yet the explanation does not wholly satisfy me
And yet this notion is, I conceive
And yet though this be true
And yet we ought, if we are wise
And you may also remember this
And, of course, you are aware
And, sir, a word
Animated by noble pride
Announced in a tone of pious satisfaction
Another circumstance that adds to the difficulty
Another consideration which I shall adduce   
Another instance of signal success
Another of these presumptions
Another point is made as clear as crystal
Another reason of a kindred nature
Another reflection which occurs to me
Another sign of our times
Another signal advantage
Another striking instance
Another thought importuned him
Answering your recent inquiry
Answers doubtless may be given
Anticipated with lively expectation
Anticipation painted the world in rose
Any information you may give us will be appreciated
Any time that may suit your convenience
Appalled in speechless disgust
Apparent rather than real
Apparently I was wrong
Appeal to a tardy justice
Appealing to the urgent temper of youth
Appreciably above the level of mediocrity
Apprehensive solicitude about the future
Arbitrary assumption of power
Ardent words of admiration
Ardently and enthusiastically convinced
Are there not many of us
Are we content to believe
Are we forever to deprive ourselves
Are we not startled into astonishment
Are we satisfied to assume
Are we wandering from the point?
Are you a trifle--bored?
Are you fully reconciled?
Are you not complicating the question?
Are you prepared to go to that length?
Are you still obdurate?
Argued with immense force and feeling
Armed all over with subtle antagonisms
Arrayed with scrupulous neatness
Arrogance and untutored haughtiness
Artless and unquestioning devotion
As I dropped like a bolt from the blue
As I dwelt like a sparrow among the spires
As I have now replied to
As I look around on this assembly
As I rise to respond to the sentiment
As I understand this matter
As a child in play scatters the heaps of sand
As a cloud that gathers her robe like drifted snow
As a flower after a drought drinks in the steady plunging rain
As a general rule I hold
As a last illustration
As a leaf that beats on a mountain
As a lion grieves at the loss of her whelps
As a man plowing all day longs for supper and welcomes sunset
As a matter of convenience and economy
As a matter of fact
As a proof of this
As a sea disturbed by opposing winds
As a special favor we ask
As amusing as a litter of likely young pigs
As an illustration of this truth
As an impartial bystander
As arbitrary as a cyclone and as killing as a pestilence
As austere as a Roman matron
As beautiful as the purple flush of dawn
As belated as they are fallacious
As blind as a mole
As brief as sunset clouds in heaven
As briefly as I may
As bright as sunlight on a stream
As busy as a bee
As by a secret of freemasonry
As cattle driven by a gadfly
As chimney sweepers come to dust
As clear as a whistle
As clear as the parts of a tree in the morning sun
As close as oak and ivy stand
As delicate and as fair as a lily
As delightful to the mind as cool well-water to thirsty lip
As diamond cuts diamond
As direct and unvarying as the course of a homing bird
As directed in your letter, we are shipping to you
As distinct as night and morning
As dry as desert dust
As dumb as a fish
As easily as the sun shines
As easy as a turn of the hand
As elastic as a steel spring
As explained in our previous letter
As extinct as the dodo
As faint as the memory of a sound
As familiar to him as his alphabet
As far as my limits allow
As far as this is true
As far as this objection relates
As far as we know
As fatal as the fang of the most venomous snake
As fleeting and elusive as our dreams
As foam from a ship's swiftness
As for the rest
As fresh and invigorating as a sea-breeze
As full of eager vigor as a mountain stream
As full of spirit as a gray squirrel
As gay and busy as a brook
As gently as the flower gives forth its perfume
As gently as withered leaves float from a tree
As graceful as a bough
As grave as a judge
As great as the first day of creation
As high as heaven
As if a door were suddenly left ajar into some world unseen before
As if smitten by a sudden spasm
As impossible as to count the stars in illimitable space
As in the footsteps of a god
As inaccessible to his feet as the clefts and gorges of the clouds
As inexorable as the flight of time
As innocent as a new laid egg
As iridescent as a soap bubble
As it happens, your conjecture is right
As it will give us an opportunity to demonstrate our ability
As locusts gather to a stream before a fire
As mellow and deep as a psalm
As memory scans the past
As men strip for a race, so must an author strip for the race with time
As merry as bees in clover
As nimble as water
As odious as it is absurd
As one who has climbed above the earth's eternal snowline
As pale as any ghost
As patient as the trees
As quick as the movement of some wild animal
As quiet as a nun breathless with adoration
As radiant as the rose
As readily and naturally as ducklings take to water
As reticent as a well-bred stockbroker
As ridiculous as it was unnecessary
As ruthlessly as the hoof of a horse tramples on a rose
As shallow streams run dimpling all the way
As simple as the intercourse of a child with its mother
As sleep falls upon the eyes of a child
As society is now constituted
As some one has well said
As some vast river of unfailing source
As stars that shoot along the sky
As stated in our previous letter
As still as a stone
As stupid as a sheep
As sudden as a dislocated joint slipping back into place
As summer winds that creep from flower to flower
As supple as a step-ladder
As swaggering and sentimental as a penny novellete
As swift as thought
As the accumulation of snowflakes makes the avalanche
As the bubble is extinguished in the ocean
As the dew upon the roses warms and melts the morning light
As the fair cedar, fallen before the breeze,
As the foregoing instances have shown
As the light straw flies in dark'ning whirlwinds
As the lightning cleaves the night
As the long train sweeps away into the golden distance
As the loud blast that tears the skies
As the slow shadows of the pointed grass mark the eternal periods
As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance
As though Pharaoh should set the Israelites
As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again
As to the particular instance before us
As unapproachable as a star
As we have received no response from you
As we scan the vague unknown
As we shall see in a few moments
As weird as the elfin lights
As well might we compare
As well try to photograph the other side of the moon
As you probably have been told
As you, doubtless, are aware
As your experience has probably shown you
Assailed by poignant doubts
Assume a menacing attitude
Assumed almost heroic proportions
Assuredly I do
Assuredly it is this
Assuring you of every courtesy
Assuring you of our entire willingness to comply with your request
Assuring you of prompt and careful cooperation
At extreme tension, like a drawn bow
At first blush it may seem fantastic
At once epigrammatic and arresting      
At once misleading and infelicitous
At the mercy of small prejudices
At the outset of this inquiry
At the present writing
At the risk of digression
At the same time, I candidly state
At the suggestion of one of our patrons
At the utmost we can say
At this juncture
At this solemn moment
At your earliest opportunity
Attained by rigorous self-restraint
Attended by insuperable difficulties
August and imperial names in the kingdom of thought
Averted by some happy stroke of fortune
Await the sentence of impartial posterity
Awaited with feverish anxiety
Awaiting his summons to the eternal silence
Awaiting the favor of your prompt attention
Awaiting the pleasure of serving you
Awaiting your early communication
Awaiting your further commands
Awaiting your pleasure
Away he rushed like a cyclone
Away then with the notion
Awkward as a cart-horse
Babbling like a child
Balmy in manner as a bland southern morning
Bandied about from mouth to mouth
Bandied to and fro
Banish such thoughts
Barricade the road to truth
Bartering the higher aspirations of life
Based on a fundamental error
Be assured, then
Be confident, therefore
Be it so
Be like the granite of thy rock-ribbed land
Be not deceived
Be sure that in spite of
Be these things as they may
Be your interests what they may be
Beaming with pleasurable anticipation
Bear with me for a few moments
Bearing on this point
Beauteous she looks as a water-lily
Beautiful as the dawn, dominant as the sun
Beauty maddens the soul like wine
Before I close I will particularly remark
Before I come to the special matter
Before I proceed to compare
Before attempting to answer this question
Before going further
Before was the open malignant sea
Beguile the tedium of the journey
Beguiled the weary soul of man
Beheld great Babel, wrathful, beautiful,
Being fully of the opinion
Being persuaded then
Believing you will answer this promptly
Believing, as I do
Bemoaning and bewailing his sad fortune
Beneath a sky as fair as summer flowers
Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night
Bent like a wand of willow
Bent on the lofty ends of her destiny
Beset by agreeable hallucinations
Beset with external dangers
Beset with smiling hills
Beside himself in an ecstasy of pleasure
Betokening an impulsive character
Betrayed into deplorable error
Bewildering multiplication of details
Beyond all question we
Beyond the dreams of avarice
Beyond the farthest edge of night
Bidden by your invitation to a discussion
Birds were fluting in the tulip-trees
Biting sentences flew about
Black as a foam-swept rock
Black his hair as the wintry night
Black inky night
Blended with courage and devotion
Blind leaders of the blind
Blithe as a bird               
Blithe with the bliss of the morning
Blown about by every wind of doctrine
Blunt the finer sensibilities
Blustering desire for publicity
Bookish precision and professional peculiarity
Borne from lip to lip
Borne onward by slow-footed time
Borne with a faculty of willing compromise
Bound up with impossibilities and absurdities
Bounded by the narrow fences of life
Bowed like a mountain
Bowed with a certain frigid and deferential surprise
Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk
Breathed an almost exaggerated humility
Breathed like a sea at rest
Bred in the tepid reticence of propriety
Brief ventures of kindliness
Bright as a diamond in the sun
Bright as a fallen fragment of the sky
Bright as the coming forth of the morning, in the cloud of an early shower
Bright as the sunbeams
Bright as the tear of an angel, glittered a lonely star
Brilliant and gay as a Greek
Brilliant display of ingenious argument
Bring odium upon the individual
Brisk as a wasp in the sunshine
Brisk directness of speech
Brittle and bent like a bow
Broadly speaking
Broke in a stupendous roar upon the shuddering air
Bronze-green beetles tumbled over stones, and lay helpless on their backs
Brown as the sweet smelling loam
Browsing at will on all the uplands of knowledge and thought
Brutal recognition of failure
Brute terrors like the scurrying of rats in a deserted attic
Buffeted by all the winds of passion
Buried hopes rose from their sepulchers
Buried in his library like a mouse in a cheese
Buried in the quicksands of ignorance
Burns like a living coal in the soul
Bursts of unpremeditated frankness
But I am bound to say
But I am certain from my own experience
But I am very sorry to say
But I am willing enough to admit
But I can at least say
But I can not conceive
But I can promise
But I cherish the hope
But I confess that I should be glad
But I digress
But I do not propose all these things
But I do say this
But I have been insisting simply
But I have heard it argued
But I have no fear of the future
But I leave this train of thought
But I look at the practical side
But I may be permitted to speak
But I may say in conclusion
But I need hardly assert
But I pass that over
But I propose to speak to you
But I repeat
But I resist the temptation
But I return to the question
But I shall go still further
But I simply ask
But I submit the whole subject
But I trust that you will all admit
But I venture to assure you
But I wander from my point
But I will allude
But I will not further impress any idea
But I would earnestly impress upon you
But across it, like a mob's menace, fell the thunder
But after all, I think no one can say
But again, when we carefully consider
But am I wrong in saying
But apart from the fact
But are you not taking a slightly one-sided point of view?
But besides these special facts
But can this question
But consider for a moment
But delusions and phantasmagoria
But depend upon it
But despite all this
But do not let us depend
But do you imagine
But doubts here arise
But even admitting these possibilities
But everyone who deserves
But first of all, remark, I beg you
But grave problems confront us
But here I am discussing
But here let me say
But how can we pass over
But how shall I describe my emotions
But however that may be
But if I may even flatter myself
But if I seek for illustrations
But if you want more evidence
But if you wish to know
But in making this assertion
But in my opinion there is no need
But in the course of time
But is it quite possible to hold
But is this any reason why
But it does not follow from this
But it happens very fortunately
But it has been suggested to me
But it is a fact
But it is impossible for one
But it is necessary to explain
But it is no use protesting
But it is not fair to assert
But it is not my intention
But it is not necessary to suppose
But it is not possible to believe
But it is not really so
But it is otherwise with
But it is sometimes said
But it may be doubted whether
But it may happen that I forgot
But it will be a misfortune
But it will naturally be asked
But it will perhaps be argued
But it would be vain to attempt
But let me ask you to glance
But let me before closing refer
But let none of you think
But let us also keep ever in mind
But let us look a little further
But lo! all of a sudden
But mark this
But more than all things else
But my allotted time is running away
But my answer to this objection
But never was a grosser wrong
But none the less peremptorily
But not for one moment
But notwithstanding all this
But now I'll confide something to you
But now look at the effect
But now take notice of
But on the other hand
But on what ground are we
But passing these by
But perhaps I ought to speak distinctly
But perhaps I'm hardly fair when I say that
But perhaps you are not yet weary
But putting these questions aside
But quite contrary to this, you will find
But recollect, I pray you, how
But seriously speaking, what is the use of it?
But some other things are to be noted
But some will ask me
But sooner or later
But still, I repeat
But suppose the fact
But surely that is inconsistent
But surely, you can not say
But that I may not divert you from
But that is beside the mark
But that is not all
But that must be always the impression
But that's a tremendous hazard
But the fact is
But the final value
But the greatest proof of all
But the most formidable problem
But the necessity of the case
But the question may arise
But the thing is simply impossible
But there is another duty imposed
But there is much more than this
But there's one thing you haven't said
But this I do not hesitate to say
But this I fearlessly affirm
But this I know
But this is a circuitous argument
But this is a digression
But this is no place for controversy
But this is not all
But this is what I mean
But this much I affirm as true
But this warns me
But this we may put aside
But thou art fled, like some frail exhalation
But to go still further
But to say the truth
But we are met with the assertion
But we are to recollect
But we ask, perhaps
But we may depend upon it
But we think it is not wise
But we want something more for explanation
But what a blunder would be yours
But what do you yourself think about it?
But what is the fact
But what we must needs guard against
But when it is declared
But when we look a little deeper
But while it may be admitted
But who could foresee what was going to happen?
But who has not seen
But why do I numerate these details
But with these exceptions
But yet nothing can be more splendid
But you are open to persuasion?
But you do not know for certain
But you must tell me more
But you should know
But, above all things, let us
But, further, I shall now demonstrate
But, gentlemen, I must be done
But, my friends, pause for a moment
But, sir, it is manifest
But, then, let us ask ourselves
But, wait, you haven't heard the end
Butterflies like gems
By a curious chance, I know it very well
By a curious irony of fate
By a curious perversity of fate
By a happy turn of thinking
By a happy turn of thinking
By a whimsical diversion
By common consent
By means of crafty insinuations
By no means
By no means desirable, I think
By no means inconsolable
By temperament incompatible
By the common judgment of the thinking world
By the sheer centripetal force of sympathy
By the way, I have not mentioned
By this time it will be suspected
By virtue of a common understanding
By virtue of his impassioned curiosity
By way of rejoinder
Calculated to create disgust
Calm as the night
Calm like a flowing river
Calm like a mountain brooding o'er the sea
Calm strength and constancy
Calmly dropping care like a mantle from her shoulders
Can I persuade you?
Can it be supposed
Can the long records of humanity teach us
Can there be a better illustration
Can we pretend
Can you imagine anything so horrible?
Can you lightly contemplate
Can you yield yourselves
Capable of a severe scientific treatment
Capacity for urbanity and moderation
Carried into port by fair winds
Carried the holiday in his eye
Cast thy voice abroad like thunder
Caught unawares by a base impulse
Cautious and practical thinkers ask
Ceaseless tramp of humanity
Censured for his negligence
Certain circumstances make it undesirable
Certain it is
Certainly I am not blind to the faults
Certainly not, if it displeases you
Certainly, one can conceive
Certainly, with the greatest pleasure
Chafed at the restraints imposed on him
Championing the cause of religious education
Charm upon charm in her was packed, like rose-leaves in a costly vase
Chaste as the icicle
Chastened and refined by experience
Checked by the voice of authority
Cheeks as soft as July peaches
Cheeks furrowed by strong purpose and feeling
Cherished the amiable illusion
Cherishing a huge fallacy
Childishly inaccurate and absurd
Childlike contour of the body
Chill breath of winter
Chivalrous loyalty and high forbearance
Choked by the thorns and brambles of early adversity
Cities scattered over the world like ant-hills
Cities that rise and sink like bubbles
Cleansed of prejudice and self-interest
Clear and definite like the glance of a child or the voice of a girl
Clear as a forest pool
Clear as crystal
Clearly enough
Clenched little hands like rumpled roses, dimpled and dear
Clever and captivating eloquence
Cloaked in prim pretense
Clothed with the witchery of fiction
Cloud-like that island hung afar
Clouds like the petals of a rose
Cloudy mirror of opinion
Clutch at the very heart of the usurping mediocrity
Coarse and glittering ostentation
Coherent and continuous trend of thought
Cold and hard as steel
Cold as the white rose waking at daybreak
Cold gaze of curiosity
Cold, glittering monotony like frosting around a cake
Collapse into a dreary and hysterical depression
Collapsed like a concertina
Colored like a fairy tale
Come, where's your sense of humor?
Coming back to the main subject
Coming down to modern times
Coming to present circumstances
Commended by perfect suavity
Comment of rare and delightful flavor
Common ground of agreement
Common sense indicates
Companionless as the last cloud of an expiring storm
Complicated and infinitely embittered
Complying with your request
Conceded from a sense of justice
Conceived with imperfect knowledge
Concentrated and implacable resolve
Conditions make it obligatory for us
Conditions of unspeakable humiliation
Conducive to well-being and efficiency
Confused rumblings presaging a different epoch
Conjuring up scenes of incredible beauty and terror
Conscious of unchallenged supremacy
Consecration that like a golden thread
Consequently, I am not discussing this matter
Consider, I beg you, what
Constant as gliding waters
Constant indulgence of wily stratagem and ambitious craft
Constrained by the sober exercise of judgment
Consult me when you want me--at any time
Consumed by a demon of activity
Contemplating these marvelous changes
Contemptuously indifferent to the tyranny of public opinion
Contending like ants for little molehill realms
Continuous and stubborn disregard
Continuous as the stars that shine
Contrary to the clearest conviction of his judgment
Couched in terms of feigned devotion
Covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance
Cowslips, like chance-found gold
Credulous and emotionally extravagant
Creed of incredulity and derision
Creeds like robes are laid aside
Creeping like a snail, unwillingly to school
Crisp sparkle of the sea
Criticized with unsparing vigor
Crude undigested masses of suggestion
Cruel and baseless calumnies
Cruel as death
Crystallize about a common nucleus
Cultivated with a commensurate zeal
Curious as a lynx
Current play of light gossip
Curtains of opaque rain
Cuts into the matter as with a pen of fire
Cynically repudiate all obligations
Daily usages and modes of thinking
Dainty as flowers
Dallying in maudlin regret over the past
Dance like a wave of the sea
Dangerously near snobbery
Dark and deep as night
Dark as pitch
Dark trees bending together as though whispering secrets
Dark with unutterable sorrows
Darkly insinuating what may possibly happen
Darkness oozed out from between the trees
Dawn had broken
Day stood distinct in the sky
Days of vague and fantastic melancholy
Days that are brief and shadowed
Dazzled by their novelty and brilliance
Dazzling white as snow in sunshine
Deafening and implacable as some elemental force
Dear as remembered kisses after death
Dear as the light that visits these sad eyes
Dearer than night to the thief
Debased by common use
Debasing fancies gather like foul birds
Decidedly so
Deep as the fathomless sea
Deep dark well of sorrow
Deep essentials of moral grandeur
Deep shame and rankling remorse
Deeply engrossed in congenial work
Deeply moved as well as keenly stung
Deeply rooted in the heart of humanity
Defiant of analysis and rule
Deficient in affectionate or tender impulses
Degenerate into comparative feebleness
Degenerated into deadness and formality
Degrading and debasing curiosity
Deliberate and cautious reflection
Delicacy of perception and quick tact
Delicate as nymphs
Delicate as the flush on a rose or the sculptured line on a Grecian urn
Delicately emerging stars
Delicious throng of sensations
Delude many minds into acquiescence
Delude not yourselves with the belief
Denominational lines like stone walls
Dense to the point of stupidity
Depend upon it
Dependency had dropped from her like a cast-off cloak
Descanting on them cursorily      
Despite her pretty insolence
Despondency clung to him like a garment that is wet
Destructive as the lightning flash
Devices generally held to be discreditable
Devious and perilous ways
Devoid of hysteria and extravagance
Dexterous modes of concealment
Dictated by an overweening partiality
Did it ever occur to you
Die like flies
Differ in degree only and not in kind
Difficult and abstruse questions      
Difficult then as the question may be
Diffidence overwhelmed him
Diffusing beneficent results
Dignified by deliberation and privacy
Dignity and sweet patience were in her look
Dim opalescence of the moon
Dimly foreshadowed on the horizon
Dimly implying some sort of jest
Dimmed by the cold touch of unjust suspicion
Dine with me to-morrow night?--if you are free?
Dip and surge lightly to and fro, like the red harbor-buoy
Disappearing into distance like a hazy sea
Discreditable and insincere support
Disdaining the guidance of reason
Disenchanting effect of time and experience
Disfigured by glaring faults
Disfigured by passages of solemn and pompous monotony.
Disguised in sentimental frippery
Disguised itself as chill critical impartiality
Dismal march of death
Dispel all anxious concern
Displayed enormous power and splendor
Dissatisfaction had settled on his mind like a shadow
Dissolve like some unsubstantial vision faded
Distinguish themselves by their eccentricities
Distinguished by hereditary rank or social position
Distract and beguile the soul
Distracted by contending desires
Distressing in their fatuous ugliness
Diversity of mind and temperament
Diverted into alien channels
Diverting her eyes, she pondered
Divested of all personal feelings
Do I need to describe
Do I presume too much?
Do I seem very ungenerous?
Do make a music like to rustling satin
Do me the honor of believing
Do not hesitate to let us know
Do not imagine
Do not let us conceal from ourselves
Do not misunderstand me
Do not overlook this opportunity
Do not suppose for a moment
Do not talk to me of
Do not the circumstances justify it?
Do not think me guilty of
Do we not know
Do what you will
Do you ask how that can be
Do you attach any particular meaning to that?
Do you believe this can be truthfully said
Do you know what his chief interests are now?
Do you know, I envy you that
Do you mind my making a suggestion?
Do you not know I am speaking of
Do you press me to tell?
Do you realize that you can
Do you really regard him as a serious antagonist?
Do you remember a concrete instance
Do you think there is anything ominous in it?
Do you think, then
Does any man say
Does it ever occur to you
Does it not seem something like idiocy to
Does it not shock you to think
Does it please you so tremendously?
Does it seem incredible?
Does not the event show
Does not the nature of every man revolt
Dogged and shameless beyond all precedent
Dogging them like their own shadow
Dogs the footsteps
Doled out in miserly measure
Dominated by no prevailing taste or fashion
Don't be so dismal, please
Don't delude yourself
Don't let me encroach on your good nature
Don't think I am unappreciative of your kindness
Doomed by inexorable fate
Doomed to impermanence and transiency
Dost thou not hear the murmuring nightingale
Doubt tortured him
Doubtless the end is sought
Doubts beset her lonely and daring soul
Down the steep of disenchantment
Draw back in distrust and misgiving
Dreaded and detested rival
Dreams and visions were surpassed
Dreams that fade and die in the dim west
Drear twilight of realities
Drift along the stream of fancy
Driven towards disaffection and violence
Drop like a feather, softly to the ground
Drowned in the deep reticence of the sea
Drowned like rats
Drowsiness coiled insidiously about him
Due to historical perspective
Dull and trite commonplaces
Dull as champagne
Dull black eyes under their precipice of brows
Dwindled to alarmingly small dimensions
Each like a corpse within its grave
Each moment was an iridescent bubble fresh-blown from the lips of fancy
Eager with the headlong zest of a hunter for the game
Eager-hearted as a boy
Ears that seemed as deaf as dead man's ears
Earth danced under a heat haze
Easily moved to gaiety and pleasure
Easy as a poet's dream
Easy-going to the point of lethargy
Either way her fate was cruel
Either way is perplexing
Elementary principles of right and wrong
Embittered and fanatical agitation
Embrace with ardor the prospect of serene leisure
Eminently proper, I think
Emotions flashed across her face
Enclosed please find a memorandum
Enclosed we beg to hand you
Enclosed you will find a circular which will fully explain
Encrusted with pedantry and prejudice    
Endearing sweetness and manner
Endeavoring to smile away his chagrin
Endless and intricate technicalities
Endlessly shifting moods
Endowed with all those faculties
Endowed with life and emphasis
Endowed with undreamed-of powers
Enduring with smiling composure
Enforced by coercive measures
Enjoyed with astonishing unscrupulousness
Enormities of crime and anomalies of law
Entangled in theological controversy
Enticed irresistibly by the freedom of an open horizon
Entirely futile and negligible
Erroneous assumptions and sophistries
Espoused with extraordinary ardor
Essay a flight of folly
Essentially one-sided and incomplete
Eternal as the skies
Eternally fruitful and stimulating
Evanescent as bubbles                
Evanescent shades of feeling        
Events took an unexpected sinister turn
Every curve of her features seemed to express
Every flake that fell from heaven was like an angel's kiss
Every lineament was clear as in the sculptor's thought
Every now and then you will find
Every one has asked himself
Every one therefore ought to look to
Every phrase is like the flash of a scimitar
Every reader of history can recall
Everyone looks at it differently
Everyone on the watch, like a falcon on its nest
Everywhere the fragrance of a bountiful earth
Evidently malicious and adroit
Evinces a hardened conscience and an insensibility to shame
Exact and resolute allegiance
Examples of terrific and explosive energy
Exasperated by what seemed a wilful pretense of ignorance
Exasperating to the last degree
Excruciating cruelty and injustice
Excuse my bluntness
Exhibits itself in fastidious crotchets
Expectation darkened into anxiety
Experience and instinct warred within her
Exploded like a penny squib
Exposed to damaging criticism
Exposing his arrogance and folly to merited contempt
Expressions of unrestrained grief
Exquisite graciousness of manner
Exquisite lucidity of statement
Exquisitely stung by the thought
Extraordinarily subtle and penetrating analysis
Exuberant rush of words
Eyes as deeply dark as are the desert skies
Eyes as luminous and bright and brown as waters of a woodland river
Eyes half veiled by slumberous tears,
Eyes like a very dark topaz
Eyes like deep wells of compassionate gloom
Eyes like limpid pools in shadow
Eyes like mountain water that o'erflowing on a rock
Faces pale with bliss, like evening stars
Facile and fertile literary brains
Fade away like a cloud in the horizon
Faint and distant as the light of a sun that has long set
Faintly, like a falling dew
Fair and fleet as a fawn
Fair as a star when only one is shining in the sky
Faithfully and religiously eschewed        
Fallen into the convenient oblivion of the waste-basket
Fallen like dead leaves on the highway
Falling away like a speck in space
Familiar and endearing intimacy
Fanatical and dangerous excesses
Fanciful and extravagant as a caliph's dream
Fanciful, I should say
Far from it
Far off and incredibly remote
Fastidious correctness of form
Fatally and indissolubly united
Fate had turned and twisted a thousand ways
Fathomless depths of suffering
Fawning like dumb neglected lap-dogs
Fear held him in a vice
Fed by many currents from the long stream of human experience
Feeding his scholarly curiosity
Feeling humiliated by the avowal
Feigning a virtuous indignation
Felicitousness in the choice and exquisiteness in the collocation of words
Felt her breath upon his cheek like a perfumed air
Fertility of argumentative resource
Fettered by poverty and toil
Feverish tide of life
Few indeed there are
Few subjects are more fruitful
Few things impress the imagination more
Fictitious and adventitious aid
Fields of young grain and verdured pastures like crushed velvet
Fierce as a bear in defeat
Fierce as the flames
Fills life up like a cup with bubbling and sparkling liquor
Finally, it is my most fervent prayer
Fine precision of intent
Finely touched to the fine issues
First in my thoughts are
First of all I ask
Fit closely together as the close-set stones of a building
Fit to stand the gaze of millions
Fitful tumults of noble passion
Fits and starts of generosity
Fix'd like a beacon-tower above the waves of a tempest
Fixed convictions of mankind
Flame like a flag unfurled
Flap loose and slack like a drooping sail
Flashed with the brilliancy of a well-cut jewel
Fled like sweet dreams
Fleet as an arrow
Fleeting touches of something alien and intrusive
Flitted like a sylph on wings
Floating in the clouds of reverie
Flouted as unpractical
Flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love
Fluctuations of prosperity and adversity
Fluent as a rill, that wanders silver-footed down a hill
Fluid as thought
Flushed with a suffusion that crimsoned her whole countenance
Fluttered like gilded butterflies in giddy mazes
Foolish and inflexible superstition
For I must tell you
For behold
For if any one thinks that there is
For instance, I can fancy
For is it not true
For it is not right to
For let it be observed first
For mark you
For my own part, I believe
For myself, certainly I think
For observe what the real fact is
For one I deny
For so it generally happens
For some years past
For the sake of my argument
For the simplest of reasons
For this is what I say
For this reason, indeed, it is
For we all know
For your convenience we enclose a stamped envelope
For your further information we take pleasure in sending to you
For, be assured of this
For, in truth, if you please to recollect
For, perhaps, after all
For, perhaps, some one may say
Forebodings possessed her
Foreshadowing summer's end
Forever echo in the heart
Forever sings itself in memory
Forgive me if I seem disobliging
Formless verbosity and a passionate rhetoric
Fortunate, to say the least
Fortunately I am not obliged
Fortunately for us
Fostering and preserving order
Fragile as a spider's web
Fragments of most touching melody
Frankly, I don't see why it should
Frankly, we believe it is extremely worth while for you
Free as the air, from zone to zone I flew
Free as the winds that caress
Free from all controversial pettifogging
Free from rigid or traditional fetters
Freedom and integrity of soul
Freighted with strange, vague longings
Freighted with the most precious cargoes
Frequently recurring forms of awkwardness
Fresh and unsuspected loveliness
Fresh and unworn as the sea that breaks languidly beside them
Fresh as a jewel found but yesterday
Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail
Frightened like a child in the dark
From one point of view we are
From the circumstances already explained
From the standpoint of
From the standpoint of expediency and effectiveness
From the standpoint of serviceability
From this statement you will perceive
Frosty thraldom of winter                 
Frugal to a degree
Fugitive felicities of thought and sensation
Full and tuneful diction
Full of ardent affection and gratitude
Full of dreams and refinements and intense abstractions
Full of majestic tenderness
Full of presentiments of some evil
Full of singular freshness, insight and power
Full of speculation and a deep restrained excitement
Full-throated as the sea
Fulsome praise, I call it
Fumble and stumble in helpless incapacity
Furious as eagles
Gain the applause of future ages
Gathering all her scattered impulses into a passionate act of courage
Gaze dimly through a maze of traditions
Gazed like a star into the morning light
Generally speaking
Generosity pushed to prudence
Generous to a pathetic and touching degree
Give me your sympathy and counsel
Give vent to his indignation
Giving an ear to a little neighborly gossip
Glances and smiles of tacit contempt
Glaring like noontide
Gleam like a diamond on a dancing girl
Gleams of sunlight, bewildered like ourselves,
Glistening like threads of gold
Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid
Glittering like an aigrette of stars
Glorious to contemplate
Glowing with haste and happiness
Gnawing at the vitals of society
Go straight, as if by magic, to the inner meaning
Goaded on by his sense of strange importance
God be praised
Gone astray as a sheep that is lost
Gone like a glow on the cloud at the close of day
Gone like tenants that quit without warning
Good! that is at least something
Gorgeous as the hues of heaven
Grace and gentleness of manner
Graceful length of limb and fall of shoulders
Graceful succession of sentences
Grant this true
Granting all this
Gratifying, I am sure
Gratuitous and arbitrary meddling
Grazing through a circulating library
Great scarlet poppies lay in drifts and heaps,
Great shuddering seized on her
Green hills pile themselves upon each other's shoulders
Greeted with unalloyed satisfaction
Grim and sullen after the flush of the morning
Grooves of intellectual habit
Growing sense of bewilderment and dismay
Guilty and baffled antagonists
Guilty of girlish sentimentality
Habits of unintelligent routine
Habitual self-possession and self-respect
Had I time for all that might be said
Had my limits allowed it
Hair as harsh as tropical grass and gray as ashes
Half choked by a rising paroxysm of rage
Half-suffocated by his triumph
Hangs like a blue thread loosen'd from the sky
Happily for us
Happily there are exceptions to every rule
Happy and gracious willingness
Hard, sharp, and glittering as a sword
Hard-souled and joyously joyous
Hardened into convictions and resolves
Hardly less marvelous
Hardly will anyone venture to say
Harnessed men, like beasts of burden, drew it to the river-side
Has it really come to that?
Haughtiness and arrogance were largely attributed to him
Haunt the recesses of the memory
Haunted by blank misgivings
Haunted with a chill and unearthly foreboding
Haunts you like the memory of some former happiness
Have I exaggerated
Have I incurred your displeasure?
Have you any rooted objection to it?
Have you anything definite in your mind?
Have you ever noticed
Have you reflected what the consequences might be to yourself?
Having taken a view of
Having thus described what appears to me
He accosted me with trepidation
He adroitly shifted his ground
He affected neither pomp nor grandeur
He airily lampooned their most cherished prejudices
He became more blandly garrulous   
He began to laugh with that sibilant laugh
He bent upon the lightning page like some rapt poet o'er his rhyme
He bolted down the stairs like a hare
He bowed submission
He braced himself to the exquisite burden of life
He clatters like a windmill
He condescended to intimate speech with her
He conversed with a colorless fluency
He could detect the hollow ring of fundamental nothingness
He could do absolutely naught
He danced like a man in a swarm of hornets
He declined the proffered hospitality
He does me too much honor
He drank of the spirit of the universe
He drew near to a desperate resolve
He dropped into an eloquent silence
He eludes analysis and baffles description
He evinced his displeasure by a contemptuous sneer or a grim scowl
He feels it acutely
He fell as falls some forest lion, fighting well
He fell down on my threshold like a wounded stag
He felt an unaccountable loathing
He felt the ironic rebound of her words
He flung diffidence to the winds
He flushed crimson
He found the silence intolerably irksome
He frowned perplexedly
He gave her a baffled stare
He gave himself to a sudden day-dream
He gave his ear to this demon of false glory
He glanced at her indulgently
He grew wanton with success
He had acted exactly like an automaton
He had acted with chivalrous delicacy of honor
He had the eye of an eagle in his trade
He had the gift of deep, dark silences
He had the habit of self-engrossed silences
He harbored his misgivings in silence
He has a queer conception of the proprieties
He held his breath in admiring silence
He is a poor dissembler   
He is anything but obtuse
He is so ludicrously wrong
He is the best prophet who
He is the most guileless of men
He laughed away my protestations
He lay as straight as a mummy
He lay like a warrior taking his rest
He lent no countenance to the insensate prattle
He listened greedily and gazed intent
He lived as modestly as a hermit
He looked fagged and sallow, like the day   
He looked with the bland, expressionless stare of an overgrown baby
He made a loathsome object
He made the politest of monosyllabic replies
He murmured a civil rejoinder
He murmured a vague acceptance
He mused a little while in grave thought
He never wears an argument to tatters
He only smiled with fatuous superiority
He paused, stunned and comprehending
He perceived the iron hand within the velvet glove
He played with grave questions as a cat plays with a mouse
He poured bitter and biting ridicule on his discomfited opponents
He radiated vigor and abundance like a happy child
He raised a silencing hand
He ruled autocratically
He sacrificed the vulgar prizes of life
He sat down quaking like a jelly
He sat on thorns
He saw disaster like a ghostly figure following her
He seems at times to confuse
He set his imagination adrift
He shambled away with speed
He sighed deeply, from a kind of mental depletion
He smote her quickening sensibilities
He snatched furiously at breath like a tiger snatching at meat
He spoke with a uniformity of emphasis
He spoke with sledgehammer directness
He submitted in brooding silence
He suffers nothing to draw him aside
He suppressed every sign of surprise
He surrendered himself to gloomy thought
He swayed in the sudden grip of anger
He sweeps the field of battle like a monsoon
He that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed
He threaded a labyrinth of obscure streets
He threw a ton's weight of resolve upon his muscles
He threw out phrases of ill-humor
He threw round a measuring eye
He took his courage in both hands
He treads the primrose path of dalliance
He turned on me a glance of stored intelligence
He turned on me like a thunder-cloud
He turned white as chalk
He used an unguarded adjective
He wandered restlessly through the house, like a prowling animal
He was a tall, dark, saturnine youth, sparing of speech
He was an eminent instance of
He was as splendidly serious as a reformer
He was as steady as a clock
He was as wax in those clever hands
He was aware of emotion
He was bold as the hawk
He was born to a lively and intelligent patriotism
He was dimly mistrustful of it
He was discreetly silent
He was disheveled and untidy
He was empty of thought
He was entangled in a paradox
He was giving his youth away by handfuls
He was haunted and begirt by presences
He was inexhaustibly voluble
He was measured and urbane
He was most profoundly skeptical
He was nothing if not grandiloquent
He was quaking on the precipice of a bad bilious attack
He was so extremely susceptible
He was so weak now, like a shrunk cedar white with the hoar-frost
He was utterly detached from life
He went hot and cold
He who is insensible to
He would fall into the blackest melancholies
He writes uncommonly clever letters
He writhed in the grip of a definite apprehension
He writhed with impotent humiliation
Hearts unfold like flowers before thee
Heaven forbid that I should wound your sensibility
Heavily freighted with erudition     
Heavy was my heart as stone
Heeled like an avalanche to leeward
Heights of serene contemplation
Hence arises a grave mischief
Hence it follows
Hence, as I have said
Her arms like slumber o'er my shoulders crept
Her banners like a thousand sunsets glow
Her beauty broke on him like some rare flower
Her beauty fervent as a fiery moon
Her blank gaze chilled you
Her breath is like a cloud
Her bright eyes were triumphant
Her cheeks are like the blushing cloud
Her cheeks were wan and her eyes like coals
Her dusky cheek would burn like a poppy
Her expression changed with the rapidity of a kaleidoscope
Her eyes as bright as a blazing star
Her eyes as stars of twilight fair
Her eyes danced with malice
Her eyes dilated with pain and fear
Her eyes were as a dove that sickeneth
Her eyes were full of wondering interest
Her eyes were limpid and her beauty was softened
Her eyes, glimmering star-like in her pale face
Her face changed with each turn of their talk,
Her face collapsed as if it were a pricked balloon
Her face stiffened anew into a gray obstinacy
Her face was as solemn as a mask
Her face was dull as lead
Her face was like a light
Her face was lit up by a glow of inspiration and resolve
Her face was passionless,
Her hair dropped on her pallid cheeks, like sea-weed on a clam
Her hair hung down like summer twilight
Her hair shone like a nimbus
Her hair was like a coronet
Her hands are white as the virgin rose that she wore on her wedding day
Her hands like moonlight brush the keys
Her haughty step waxed timorous and vigilant
Her head dropped into her hands like a storm-broken flower
Her head throbbed dangerously
Her heart appeared to abdicate its duties
Her heart fluttered with a vague terror
Her heart has grown icy as a fountain in the fall
Her heart pounded in her throat
Her heart was full of speechless sorrow
Her holy love that like a vestal flame had burned
Her hurrying thoughts clamored for utterance
Her imagination recoiled
Her impulse came and went like fireflies in the dusk
Her interest flagged
Her lashes like fans upon her cheek
Her laugh is like a rainbow-tinted spray
Her life had dwarfed her ambitions
Her limbs ran to marble
Her lips are like two budded roses
Her lips hardened
Her lips like a lovely song that ripples as it flows
Her lips like twilight water
Her lips parted in a keen expectancy
Her little lips are tremulous as brook-water is
Her long black hair danced round her like a snake
Her mind was a store-house of innocuous anecdote
Her mind was beaten to the ground by the catastrophe
Her mood was unaccountably chilled
Her mouth as sweet as a ripe fig
Her musings took a sudden and arbitrary twist
Her neck is like a stately tower
Her pale robe clinging to the grass seemed like a snake
Her pulses flutter'd like a dove
Her scarlet lip curled cruelly
Her skin was as the bark of birches
Her smile was faintly depreciatory
Her smile was linked with a sigh
Her solicitude thrilled him
Her stare dissolved
Her step seemed to pity the grass it prest
Her strength was scattered in fits of agitation
Her stumbling ignorance which sought the road of wisdom
Her sweetness halting like a tardy May
Her thoughts outstripped her erring feet
Her tone was gathering remonstrance
Her tongue on the subject was sharpness itself
Her tongue stumbled and was silent
Her two white hands like swans on a frozen lake
Her voice cut like a knife
Her voice had a wooden resonance and a ghost of a lisp
Her voice had the coaxing inflections of a child
Her voice like mournful bells crying on the wind
Her voice trailed off vaguely
Her voice was full of temper, hard-held
Her voice was like the voice the stars had when they sang together
Her voice was rich and vibrant, like the middle notes of a 'cello
Her voice, with a tentative question in it, rested in air
Her wariness seemed put to rout
Her words sounding like wavelets on a summer shore
Herding his thoughts as a collie dog herds sheep
Here I am considering
Here I end my illustrations
Here I must pause for a moment
Here I only insist upon
Here I ought to stop
Here again the testimony corroborates
Here and there a solitary volume greeted him
Here arises the eternal question
Here comes the practical matter
Here for a moment I seem
Here in statue-like repose, an old wrinkled mountain rose
Here is a complete answer to
Here is another strange thing
Here is good hope for us
Here is no question
Here is your opportunity
Here let me meet one other question
Here then I take up the subject
Here then is the key
Here then, we are brought to the question
Here undoubtedly it is
Here we can not but pause to contemplate
Here we come into direct antagonism with
Here we come to the very crux of
Here we have it on high authority
Here, however, it may be objected
Here, then, I am brought to the consideration
Here, then, it is natural at last
Here, then, we are involved
Hers was the loveliness of some tall white lily cut in marble,
Hidebound in official pedantry       
High and undiscouraged hope
High-handed indifference to all restraint
His accents breathed profound relief
His agitation increased
His bashfulness melted like a spring frost
His brow bent like a cliff o'er his thoughts
His brow grew knit and gloomy
His brow was in his hand
His cheeks were furrowed and writhen like rain-washed crags
His chin had too vanishing an aspect
His conscience leapt to the light
His constraint was excruciating
His curiosity is quenched
His dignity counseled him to be silent
His ears sang with the vibrating intensity of his secret existence
His eyes blazed like deep forests
His eyes glowed like blue coals
His eyes had a twinkle of reminiscent pleasantry
His eyes literally blazed with savage fire
His eyes shone with the pure fire of a great purpose
His eyes stared unseeingly
His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like moldy hay
His face burnt like a brand
His face caught the full strength of the rising wind
His face dismissed its shadow
His face fell abruptly into stern lines
His face lit with a fire of decision
His face showed a pleased bewilderment
His face torn with conflict
His face was glad as dawn to me
His face was gravely authoritative
His face was often lit up by a smile like pale wintry sunshine
His fingers were knotted like a cord
His first zeal was flagging
His formal kiss fell chill as a flake of snow on the cheek
His fortune melted away like snow in a thaw
His gaze faltered and fell
His gaze searched her face
His gaze seemed full of unconquerable hopefulness
His general attitude suggested an idea that he had an oration for you
His gestures and his gait were untidy
His glorious moments were strung like pearls upon a string
His hand supported his chin
His hands were small and prehensible
His heart asserted itself again, thunderously beating
His heart rebuked him
His heart was full of enterprise
His impatient scorn expired
His indifference fell from him like a garment
His invectives and vituperations bite and flay like steel whips
His last illusions crumbled
His lips loosened in a furtively exultant smile
His lips seemed to be permanently parted in a good-humored smile
His mind echoed with words
His mind leaped gladly to meet new issues and fresh tides of thought
His mind murmurs like a harp among the trees
His mind was dazed and wandering in a mist of memories
His mind was like a lonely wild
His mind was like a summer sky
His mood was one of pure exaltation
His mood yielded
His mouth quivered with pleasure
His nerves thrilled like throbbing violins
His passions vented themselves with sneers
His plea was irresistible
His pulses leaped anew
His reputation had withered
His retort was like a knife-cut across the sinews
His revenge descends perfect, sudden, like a curse from heaven
His sense of humor is unquenchable
His sensibilities were offended
His shrewd gaze fixed appraisingly upon her
His soul full of fire and eagle-winged
His soul was compressed into a single agony of prayer
His soul was wrung with a sudden wild homesickness
His speech faltered
His spirits sank like a stone
His swift and caustic satire
His talk is like an incessant play of fireworks
His temper was dark and explosive
His thoughts galloped
His thoughts were in clamoring confusion
His tone assumed a certain asperity   
His tone verged on the ironical
His torpid ideas awoke again
His troubled spirit shifted its load
His vagrant thoughts were in full career
His voice insensibly grew inquisitorial
His voice is as the thin faint song
His voice rose like a stream of rich distilled perfumes
His voice was like the clap of thunder
His voice was thick with resentment and futile protest
His whole face was lighted with a fierce enthusiasm
His whole frame seemed collapsed and shrinking
His whole soul wavered and shook like a wind-swept leaf
His whole tone was flippant and bumptious
His words gave a curious satisfaction,
His words trailed off brokenly
His work was ludicrously perfunctory
His youthful zeal was contagious
History is replete with predictions
Hitherto I have spoken only of
Holding this view, I am concerned
Hope was far and dim
Hopeful as the break of day
Hopelessly belated in its appearance
Hoping for a continuance of your interest
Hoping for a definite reply
Hoping that our relations may prove mutually satisfactory
Hoping to be favored with your order
How amiable you are to say so
How can I tell you how much I have enjoyed it all?
How can I thank you?
How can we help believing
How can you be so unjust?
How delightful to meet you
How do you account for
How does it happen
How does the idea appeal to you?
How droll you are!
How extraordinary!
How human language staggers when
How infinitely difficult it is
How infinitely superior must it appear
How intensely interesting!
How is this to be explained
How like a saint she sleeps
How like a winter hath my absence been
How like the sky she bends over her child
How many a time
How may we serve you further?
How momentous, then
How much better, I say, if
How much more rational it would be
How perfectly delightful!
How shall I attempt to enumerate
How shall I describe to you
How sweet and reasonable the pale shadows of those
How utterly abominable
How very agreeable this is!
How very interesting
How very surprising
How well you do it!
However, I am viewing the matter
However, I should like to hear your views
However, I will not in any way admit
However, because of the special circumstances attached
However, it is to me a very refreshing thing
Howling in the wilderness like beasts
Huge as a hippopotamus
Human nature interests me very much indeed
Humiliating paltriness of revenge
Humming-birds like lake of purple fire
Hushed as the grave
Hushed like a breathless lyre
I abide by my statement
I add a few suggestions
I adduce these facts          
I adjured him      
I admire the main drift of
I admire your foresight
I admit it most gratefully
I admit the extreme complexity
I admit, of course, at once
I again ask
I agree that something ought to be done
I agree--at least, I suppose I do
I allude to
I always delight to think
I always welcome criticism so long as it is sincere
I always will assert the right to
I am  sure you will hear me out
I am a great admirer
I am a little at a loss to know
I am about to supplement
I am absolutely bewildered
I am afraid I am not familiar enough with the subject
I am afraid I cannot suggest an alternative
I am afraid I must confess my ignorance
I am afraid I've allowed you to tire yourself
I am afraid you will call me a sentimentalist
I am agitated by conflicting emotions
I am alarmed, indeed, when I see
I am also bound to say
I am also satisfied
I am always glad to do anything to please you
I am anxious to discharge the very onerous debt I owe you
I am appealing to your sense of humor
I am apprehensive
I am asked to-night to propose
I am assured and fully believe
I am at a loss for adequate terms
I am at your service
I am bold to say
I am bound to secrecy
I am but saying
I am by no means certain
I am certain that you will give me credit
I am certainly in earnest sympathy
I am compelled to inform you
I am compelled to, unluckily
I am confident that you will be thoroughly satisfied
I am confronted by the hope
I am conscious of the fact
I am convinced by what I have seen
I am curious to learn what his motive was
I am deeply flattered and grateful
I am deeply imbued with the conviction
I am deeply insensible of the compliment
I am delighted to hear you say so
I am determined
I am directed to say to you
I am dumb with admiration
I am entirely at your disposal
I am even bold enough to hazard
I am exceeding my necessary limits
I am exceedingly glad of this opportunity
I am extremely glad you approve of it
I am extremely obliged to you
I am familiar with
I am far from asserting
I am far from believing the maxim
I am filled with admiration
I am firmly convinced
I am fortunate in being able to do you a service
I am free to admit
I am fully convinced
I am giving the matter my personal attention
I am giving voice to what you all feel
I am giving you well-deserved praise
I am glad of this public opportunity
I am glad to answer to the toast
I am glad to be able to think that
I am glad to express the belief
I am glad to have had this talk with you
I am glad to notice
I am glad to say that I have entirely lost that faculty
I am glad you can see it in that way
I am glad you feel so deeply about it
I am going to make a confession
I am going to spare you and myself
I am grateful for your good opinion
I am grateful to you for this honor
I am greatly alarmed
I am greatly indebted to you
I am happy to be with you
I am here by the favor of your invitation
I am here the advocate of
I am here to introduce
I am honestly indignant
I am in a chastened mood
I am in favor of
I am in sympathy with
I am inclined sometimes to believe
I am inclined to agree with you
I am inclined to suspect
I am incredulous
I am indebted for the honor
I am indebted to you for the suggestion
I am informed
I am led on by these reflections
I am led to believe
I am listening--I was about to propose
I am lost in admiration
I am luckily disengaged to-day
I am mainly concerned
I am more grieved than I can tell you
I am most deeply sensible of the welcome
I am most grateful for the opportunity
I am myself greatly indebted
I am naturally overjoyed
I am nevertheless too sensible
I am not a person of prejudices
I am not a stranger to
I am not about to defend
I am not advocating
I am not altogether clear
I am not an alarmist
I am not as unreasonable as you suppose
I am not at all in the secret of his ambitions
I am not at liberty to discuss
I am not at present concerned
I am not aware of a single instance
I am not blind to the faults of
I am not bold enough to
I am not capable of unraveling it
I am not catching at sharp arguments
I am not concerned to argue
I am not defending myself
I am not dreaming of denying
I am not going into sordid details
I am not going into vexed questions
I am not going to let you evade the question
I am not going to pay you any idle compliments
I am not going to reproach
I am not here to defend
I am not impervious to the obligations involved
I am not in sympathy with it
I am not in the least surprised
I am not inquisitive
I am not insensible
I am not of those who pretend
I am not prepared to dispute the word
I am not prepared to say
I am not presumptuous to assert
I am not proposing to set forth
I am not ripe to pass sentence
I am not so unreasonable as to tell you
I am not sure that I can manage it
I am not surprised
I am not taking into account
I am not unaware
I am not undertaking to deliver
I am not vindictive
I am not without a lurking suspicion
I am now going to attempt
I am obliged to add
I am obliged to go still further
I am often reminded
I am old enough to remember
I am one of those who believe
I am only too sensible of the fact
I am overjoyed to hear you say so
I am perfectly aware of what I am saying
I am perfectly willing to admit
I am persuaded
I am persuaded by your candor
I am prepared to back that opinion by
I am privileged to speak to
I am quite conscious that
I am quite convinced of that
I am quite discomfited
I am quite interested to see what you will do
I am quite ready to be convinced
I am rather disposed to think
I am rather of the opinion that I was mistaken
I am ready to do battle
I am ready to make great allowances
I am really afraid I don't know
I am really gregarious
I am reassured by the presence here
I am reluctantly but forcibly reminded
I am resolved not to permit
I am sensible of the flattery
I am sensible, sir
I am seriously annoyed with myself about it
I am simply endeavoring to show
I am so glad you think that
I am so sorry--so very sorry
I am so surrounded on every hand
I am sometimes inclined to think
I am somewhat relieved to know
I am sorry to disillusionize you
I am sorry to interrupt this interesting discussion
I am sorry to say
I am sorry to say it is impossible
I am speaking plainly
I am still a little of an idealist
I am still holding this offer open to you
I am suggesting the reason why
I am suppressing many of the details
I am sure I feel no hostility
I am sure every impartial man will agree
I am sure it sounds very strange to you
I am sure that I echo the sentiment
I am sure this generous audience will pardon me
I am sure you all hope
I am sure you could pay me no higher compliment
I am sure you feel the truth
I am sure you will acquit me
I am sure you will be kind enough
I am sure you will do me the justice
I am sure you will not be surprised
I am sure, at any rate
I am surely not here to assert
I am surprised, I confess
I am sustained by the prospect of a good dinner
I am tempted further to offer to you
I am thankful for the privilege
I am thoroughly convinced
I am to speak to you this evening
I am to urge the interest of
I am told occasionally
I am told on authority
I am too well aware of the difficulties
I am totally at a loss to conceive
I am trespassing too long on your time
I am unable to understand
I am unconscious of intentional error
I am under a very great obligation
I am under the deepest feeling of gratitude
I am under the impression
I am unwillingly bound to add
I am uttering no paradox when I say
I am vastly obliged to you
I am vastly your debtor for the information
I am very far from being a fanatic
I am very far from thinking.
I am very glad of this opportunity
I am very glad to have the honor
I am very grateful--very much flattered
I am very happy to be here
I am very much in the condition of
I am very sure that if you ponder
I am very sure you will believe
I am well aware
I am wholly in agreement with you
I am willing to accept all the consequences
I am willing to know
I am wonderfully well
I am wondering if I may dare ask you a very personal question?
I am your creditor unawares
I am, I confess, a little discouraged
I am, gentlemen, yours faithfully
I am, indeed, most solicitous
I am, my dear sir, yours faithfully
I anticipate with pleasing expectation
I anticipate your argument
I appeal in the first place
I appeal to any man to say
I appeal to the better judgment
I appreciate the significance
I appreciate your motives
I argue this cause
I ask again
I ask no greater blessing
I ask permission to speak to you
I ask that you be good enough
I ask the attention
I ask the audience
I ask the audience to return with me
I ask this of you
I ask you calmly and dispassionately
I ask you gentlemen, do you think
I ask you if it is possible
I ask you in all candor
I ask you now to follow me
I ask you to consider
I ask you to join me in drinking a toast
I ask you to pledge with me
I ask you, if you please, to rise and give the toast
I ask your attention
I ask your indulgence
I assert, sir, that it is
I assure myself
I assure you it is most painful to me
I assure you my knowledge of it is limited
I assure you, of my own personal knowledge
I attribute it to
I avail myself of the opportunity
I bear no malice about that
I beg again to thank you for the honor
I beg all to remember
I beg and implore of you
I beg emphatically to say
I beg leave to make some observations
I beg of you to remember
I beg to request that you give me some information
I beg to tender my most fervent wishes
I beg you not to mistake my meaning
I beg you to accept my grateful expression
I beg your indulgence
I beg your pardon, but you take it too seriously
I begin by observing
I begin with expressing a sentiment
I believe I can speak for all
I believe I shall make it clear to you
I believe I understand perfectly just how you feel about
I believe I voice the sentiment
I believe from my own personal experience
I believe it to be the simple truth
I believe most profoundly
I believe that I am within the mark
I believe that in this instance
I bemoaned my unlucky fate
I bid you a most cordial and hearty welcome
I bow with you in reverent commemoration
I brazenly confess it
I call hardly conceive
I call never sufficiently express my gratitude
I call on you to answer
I call to mind how
I can by no calculation justify
I can easily understand your astonishment
I can explain the apparent contradiction
I can find no satisfaction in it
I can hardly agree with you there
I can make allowance for
I can most truthfully assure you
I can never be sufficiently grateful
I can not allow myself to believe
I can not avoid confessing
I can not be content with
I can not believe, I will not believe
I can not better illustrate this argument
I can not better sum up
I can not boast of
I can not bound my vision
I can not but reflect
I can not but see what mischief
I can not charge myself with
I can not close without giving expression
I can not conceive a greater honor
I can not feel any doubt myself
I can not forbear from offering
I can not give you a better illustration
I can not help expressing a wish
I can not help speaking urgently
I can not here go into details
I can not hesitate to say
I can not hope adequately to respond
I can not justly be responsible because
I can not let this opportunity pass
I can not persuade myself
I can not prevail on myself
I can not refrain from saying for myself
I can not resist the train of thought
I can not say how glad I am
I can not say with confidence
I can not stop to give in detail
I can not sufficiently thank you
I can not take back my word
I can not take it for granted
I can not thank you enough
I can not well avoid saying
I can only congratulate you
I can only hope for indulgence
I can only tell you the bare facts
I can readily understand
I can scarcely accept the offer
I can scarcely boast that honor
I can scarcely concede anything more important
I can scarcely find fitting words
I can scarcely imagine anything more disagreeable
I can strongly recommend
I can sympathize with you
I can understand, moreover
I can with propriety speak here
I can't pretend to make a jest of what I'm going to say
I cannot altogether acquit myself of interested motives
I cannot explain it even to myself
I cannot find much real satisfaction in it
I cannot forbear to press my advantage
I cannot imagine what you mean
I cannot precisely determine
I cannot say definitely at the moment
I cannot say that in fact it is always so
I cannot see how you draw that conclusion
I cannot thank you enough for all your consideration
I capitulated by inadvertence
I certainly have not so good an opinion
I challenge any man
I cheerfully own
I cheerfully submit myself
I claim a share also for
I class them altogether under the head
I close with the words
I close with this sentiment
I come at length to
I come next to the question of
I come to the other assumption
I compliment you on your good sense
I conceive this to be
I confess I feel not the least alarmed
I confess I have had my doubts
I confess I have little sympathy
I confess it affects me very deeply to
I confess it is very difficult to
I confess that I do not entirely approve
I confess that it is a comfort to me
I confess that my notions are widely different
I confess to a little embarrassment
I confess to you that I have no fear
I confess, I find it difficult
I confine myself to saying
I congratulate you upon the auspicious character
I consider I have said enough in proof
I consider it amply explains
I contend
I content myself with pursuing
I could almost allege it as a supreme example
I could ask for nothing better
I could do no less than
I could easily mention
I could enlarge upon it
I could never forgive myself for that
I could never understand
I could wish that this belief
I cut my reflections adrift
I dare say you know
I dare say your intuition is quite right
I dare venture the remark
I declare to you
I decline to commit myself beforehand
I deem it both necessary and just
I deem it proper here to remind
I deem myself honored
I deny the inference
I deny, once and for all
I desire to be brief
I desire to bear my testimony
I desire to call attention
I desire to know
I desire to lay emphatic stress
I detest exaggeration
I didn't mean that--exactly
I dissent from the opinion
I distrust all general theories of
I do again and again urge upon you
I do not absolutely assert
I do not advocate
I do not argue
I do not ask you to
I do not at this moment remember
I do not believe it possible
I do not belong to those who
I do not choose to consume
I do not complain of
I do not comprehend your meaning
I do not consider it necessary
I do not contend
I do not countenance for a moment
I do not deem it incumbent upon me
I do not depreciate for a moment
I do not desire to call in question
I do not desire to put too much emphasis
I do not despair of surmounting
I do not disguise the fact
I do not doubt the sincerity of your arguments
I do not enter into the question
I do not exactly understand you
I do not fail to admire
I do not fear a contradiction
I do not feel at liberty
I do not feel sure that I entirely share your views
I do not find it an unpleasant subject
I do not forget the practical necessity
I do not hesitate to say
I do not imagine
I do not in the least degree
I do not indeed deny
I do not indulge in the delusion
I do not know how anyone can believe
I do not know whether you are aware of it
I do not know why
I do not know with what correctness
I do not mean anything so absurd
I do not mean now to go further than
I do not mean to impute
I do not merely urge
I do not mistrust
I do not myself pretend to be
I do not need to remind you
I do not pretend to argue
I do not propose to take up your time
I do not question for a moment
I do not recount all
I do not say anything about the future
I do not say this with any affectation
I do not see how it is possible
I do not see much difference between
I do not seek to palliate
I do not speak exclusively
I do not stop to discuss
I do not think it necessary to warn you
I do not think it possible
I do not think it unfair reasoning
I do not think myself obliged to dwell
I do not think that I need further discuss
I do not think this at all an exaggeration
I do not think we can go far wrong
I do not think you will often hear
I do not understand how it can apply
I do not vouch for
I do not want to discourage you
I do not wish to be considered egotistic
I do not wish to be misrepresented
I do not wonder
I do not, of course, deny
I do not, therefore, wonder
I do, indeed, recollect
I don't deny that it is interesting
I don't doubt it for a moment
I don't feel that it is my business
I don't insist on your believing me
I don't justify my presumption
I don't know quite why you should say that
I don't know that I can do that
I don't know when I have heard anything so lamentable
I don't know why you should be displeased
I don't make myself clear, I see
I don't pretend to explain
I don't see anything particularly wonderful in it
I don't underrate his kindness
I don't want to disguise that from you
I don't want to exaggerate
I don't want to seem critical
I doubt the truth of that saying
I doubt very much whether
I dwell with pleasure on the considerations
I earnestly maintain
I embrace with peculiar satisfaction
I end as I began
I endorse it, every word
I entertain great apprehension for
I entertain no such chimerical hopes   
I entertain the hope and opinion
I entirely approve of your plan
I entirely dissent from the view
I especially hail with approval
I even add this
I even venture to deny
I fancy I hear you say
I fancy it's just that
I fear I cannot help you
I fear I may seem trifling
I fear lest I may
I fear that's too technical for me
I fearlessly appeal
I fearlessly challenge
I feel I have a right to say
I feel a certain apprehension
I feel a great necessity to
I feel an unwonted sense of gaiety         
I feel bound to add my expression
I feel constrained to declare
I feel entirely satisfied
I feel it a proud privilege
I feel it my duty to be frank with you
I feel keenly myself impelled by every duty
I feel myself scarcely competent to judge
I feel only a great emotion of gratitude
I feel respect and admiration
I feel some explanation is due
I feel sure
I feel tempted to introduce here
I feel that I have a special right to
I feel that it is not true
I feel the greatest satisfaction
I feel the task is far beyond my power
I feel very grateful to you for your kind offer
I felt a qualm of apprehension
I fervently trust
I find it absorbing
I find it difficult to utter in words
I find it more easy
I find it rather monotonous
I find my reference to this
I find myself called upon to say something
I find myself in the position of
I find no better example than
I find no fault with
I find numberless cases
I find this agreeable mental exhilaration
I flatter myself
I forbear to inquire
I foresaw the consequence
I frankly confess that
I fully recognize
I gave notice just now
I generally trust my first impressions
I give my word gladly
I give you my most sacred word of honor
I give you, in conclusion, this sentence
I go further
I grant all this
I grant with my warmest admiration
I gratefully accept
I greatly deplore
I had a kind of hope
I had almost said
I had better begin at the beginning
I had grown pure as the dawn and the dew
I had in common with others
I had no intention of being offensive
I had occasion to criticize
I hadn't thought of it in that light
I happen to differ
I hardly dare to dwell longer
I hardly know anything more strange
I hardly think that could be so
I hasten to concede
I have a dark suspicion
I have a great admiration for
I have a hundred reasons for thinking so
I have a peculiar affection for it
I have a pleasing and personal duty
I have a profound pity for those
I have a right to consider
I have a strong belief
I have a very high respect for
I have abstained from
I have acquired some useful experience
I have all along implied
I have all but finished
I have already alluded to
I have already shown the ground of my hope
I have already stated, and now repeat
I have always been under the impression
I have always listened with the greatest satisfaction
I have always maintained
I have an immense faith in him
I have another objection
I have another observation to add
I have anticipated the objection
I have assumed throughout
I have attempted thus hastily
I have barely touched some of the points
I have been allowed the privilege
I have been asked several times
I have been constrained by circumstances
I have been decidedly impressed
I have been extremely anxious
I have been favorably impressed by your
I have been given to understand
I have been glad to observe
I have been heretofore treating
I have been insisting then on this
I have been interested in hearing
I have been longing to see more of you
I have been pointing out how
I have been profoundly moved
I have been puzzling over a dilemma
I have been requested to say a word
I have been told by an eminent authority
I have been too long accustomed to hear
I have been touched by the large generosity
I have been trying to show
I have before me the statistics
I have but one more word to add
I have demonstrated to you
I have depicted
I have endeavored to emphasize
I have enlarged on this subject
I have every reason to think so
I have felt it almost a duty to
I have found great cause for wonder
I have frequently been surprised at
I have gazed with admiration
I have generally observed
I have given you the best proof of it
I have gone back to my first impressions
I have gone so far as to suggest
I have good reason for
I have had steadily in mind
I have had the honor
I have had to take a long sweep
I have heard it objected
I have heard the Hiddon People like the hum of swarming bees
I have heard with relief and pleasure
I have hitherto been adducing instances    
I have hitherto been engaged in showing
I have in a measure anticipated
I have in my possession
I have incidentally dwelt on
I have introduced it to suggest
I have known striking instances of the kind
I have labored to maintain
I have laid much stress upon
I have lately observed many strong indications
I have listened with the utmost interest
I have little hope that I can add anything
I have lived to see
I have long ago insisted
I have long been of the conviction
I have never heard it put so well
I have never heard it suggested
I have never whispered a syllable
I have no acquaintance with
I have no delusions on that score
I have no doubt whatever
I have no excuse for intruding
I have no fear of myself
I have no fears for the success
I have no hesitation in asserting
I have no intention to moralize
I have no particular inclination
I have no prejudice on the subject
I have no pretention to be regarded
I have no reason to think
I have no scruple in saying
I have no such gloomy forebodings
I have no sympathy with the men
I have no thought of venturing to say
I have no wish at all to preach
I have not accustomed myself
I have not allowed myself
I have not been able to deny
I have not particularly referred to
I have not said anything yet
I have not succeeded in convincing myself of that
I have not the influence you think
I have not the least doubt of it
I have not the means of forming a judgment
I have not the right to reproach
I have not time to present
I have nothing more to say
I have noticed of late years
I have now explained to you
I have now made bold to touch upon
I have now much pleasure in confirming
I have now rather more than kept my word
I have now said all that occurs to me
I have often a difficulty in deciding
I have often been impressed with
I have often been struck with the resemblance
I have often lingered in fancy
I have often marveled at your courage
I have one step farther to go
I have only partially examined
I have partly anticipated
I have pleasant memories of
I have pleasure in acknowledging
I have pointed out
I have pride and pleasure in quoting
I have quite changed my opinion about that
I have racked this brain of mine
I have read with great regret
I have said and I repeat
I have said over and over again
I have said what I solemnly believe
I have scant patience
I have seen for myself
I have seen it stated in a recent journal
I have seen some signs of encouragement
I have seen the ravens flying, like banners of old wars
I have shown
I have some sort of fear
I have something of great importance to say to you
I have sometimes asked myself
I have sometimes fancied
I have sometimes vaguely felt it
I have sometimes wondered whether
I have somewhat overshot the mark
I have still two comments to make
I have taken pains to know
I have the confident hope
I have the greatest possible confidence
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt
I have the honor to propose
I have the honor to remain
I have the strongest possible prejudice against it
I have then to investigate
I have thought it incumbent on me
I have thought it right on this day
I have thought it well to suggest
I have throughout highly appreciated
I have thus been led by my feelings
I have thus stated the reason
I have to confess with a feeling of melancholy
I have to force my imagination
I have touched very cursorily
I have tried to convey to you
I have undertaken to speak
I have very much less feeling of
I have watched with some attention
I have witnessed the extraordinary
I have yet a more cogent reason
I have yet to learn
I haven't the remotest idea
I hazard nothing in saying
I hear it sometimes said
I hear you say to yourselves
I heartily congratulate you
I heartily feel the singular claims
I herewith submit my application
I hesitate to take an instance
I highly appreciate this mark of confidence
I hold it to be clearly expedient
I hold myself obliged to
I hold the maxim no less applicable
I hold this to be a truth
I hold to the principle
I hope I have expressed myself explicitly
I hope I may be allowed to intimate
I hope I shall not be told
I hope by this time we are all convinced
I hope for our own sakes
I hope it is no disparagement
I hope it will not seem unreasonable to you
I hope most sincerely and truly
I hope none who hear me
I hope not to occupy more than a few minutes
I hope that I shall not be so unfortunate
I hope the day may be far distant
I hope the time may come again
I hope to be excused if
I hope to be forgiven if
I hope we may forget
I hope we may meet again
I hope you will forgive an intruder
I hope you will not accuse me
I hope you will not think me irreverent
I hope you will pardon my seeming carelessness
I imagine that no one will be disposed
I indulge the modest hope
I insist upon it
I intend to propose
I know I am treading on thin ice
I know from experience how
I know full well
I know it has been questioned
I know it is said
I know it is very presumptuous
I know it will be said
I know many reasons why
I know my request will appear singular
I know not how else to express
I know not in what direction to look
I know not of my own knowledge
I know not where else to find
I know perfectly well
I know that it is impossible for me to
I know that this is the feeling
I know that what I may say is true
I know there are some who think
I know there is a theory among us
I know too well
I know very well the difference between
I know well it is not for me
I know well the sentiments
I know you are all impatient to hear
I know you will do all in your power
I know you will interpret what I say
I labor under a degree of prejudice
I lately heard it affirmed
I lay it down as a principle
I leave history to judge
I leave it to you
I leave the arduous task
I leave to others to speak
I like it immensely
I like your frankness
I long to speak a word or two
I look forward to pleasant personal relations in the future
I look hopefully to
I look in vain
I look with encouragement
I look with inexpressible dread
I look with mingled hope and terror
I lost myself in a reverie of gratitude
I made bold to retort
I make my appeal to
I make no extravagant claim
I make no reflection whatever
I make this abrupt acknowledgment
I marvel that
I may add, speaking for my own part
I may be allowed to make one remark
I may be permitted to add
I may confess to you
I may safely appeal
I may say to you calmly
I may seem to have been diffuse
I may take as an instance
I may venture upon a review
I mean by this
I mean it literally
I mean something more than that
I mean, moreover
I mention it to you to justify
I mention these facts because
I mention this, not by way of complaint
I might bring you another such case
I might deny that
I might enter into such detail
I might go further
I might go on indefinitely
I might go on to illustrate
I might of course point first
I might question all that
I might reasonably question the justice
I might try to explain
I might venture to claim
I might well have desired
I might well think
I mistrust these wild impulses
I most certainly agree with you
I most humbly ask pardon
I must add my congratulations on your taste
I must apologize for intruding upon you
I must ask an abrupt question
I must ask you one more question, if I may
I must be careful about what I say
I must be contented with
I must be excused if I say
I must bow in reverence
I must call your attention for a moment
I must conclude abruptly
I must confess I have never thought of that
I must confess that I became rather alarmed
I must consider this as
I must crave your indulgence
I must express to you again
I must fairly tell you
I must find some fault with
I must for want of time omit
I must hazard the story
I must here admit
I must lament
I must leave any detailed development
I must mention with praise
I must not allow myself to indulge
I must not for an instant be supposed
I must not overlook
I must now beg to ask
I must pause a moment to
I must proceed
I must qualify the statement
I must refrain from any comment
I must remind my hearers of
I must reply to some observations
I must respectfully decline to tell you
I must return to the subject
I must say that I am one of those
I must speak plainly
I must suppose, however
I must take occasion to say
I must take this opportunity to tell you
I must thank you once more
I must try to describe to you
I myself have boundless faith
I need not assure this brilliant company
I need not dwell
I need not enter into
I need not follow out the application
I need not remind you that you have a grave responsibility
I need not say how much I thank you
I need not show how inconsistent
I need not specially recommend to you
I need not wander far in search
I need not, I am certain, assure you
I need only to observe
I need say nothing in praise
I need scarcely observe
I need to guard myself right here
I neither affirm nor deny
I never heard anything so absurd
I next come to the implicit assumption
I note with particular pleasure
I notice it as affording an instance
I noticed incidentally the fact
I now address you on a question
I now come, sir, to the second head
I now have the pleasure of presenting to you
I now pass to the question of
I now proceed to inquire
I now reiterate
I object strongly to the use
I observe, then, in the first place
I offer my humblest apologies
I only ask a favorable construction of
I only marvel
I only wish you to recognize
I open the all-important question
I ought to give an illustration
I owe the idea wholly to you
I own I can not help feeling
I particularly allude to
I partly agree with you
I pass on from that
I pass then to our second division
I pause for a moment to say
I pause to confess once more
I pay tribute to
I personally know that it is so
I personally owe you a great debt of thankfulness
I place myself entirely at your service
I place the most implicit reliance on your good sense
I pray God I may never
I predict that you will
I prefer a practical view
I prefer to reserve my judgment
I presume I shall have to admit
I presume that I shall not be disbelieved
I proceed to another important phase
I profess
I propose briefly to glance at
I propose, therefore to consider
I protest I never had any doubt
I purposely evaded the question
I purposely have avoided
I question whether
I quite appreciate the very clever way you put it
I quite endorse what has been said
I quite see what the advantages are
I rather look forward to a time
I readily grant
I realize how painful it must be to you
I really am curious to know how you guessed that
I really can not think it necessary to
I really do not know
I really thought that you would excuse me
I recall another historical fact
I recognize the high compliment conveyed
I recollect hearing a sagacious remark    
I recollect it clearly
I refer especially
I refuse to believe
I regard as an erroneous view
I regard it as a tribute
I regard it as a very great honor
I regret exceedingly to inform you
I regret that I am not able to remember
I regret that it is not possible for me
I regret the time limits me
I regret this the less
I rejoice in an occasion like this
I rejoice that events have occurred
I rejoice to think I remark here
I rely on your good sense
I remain, my dear sir, yours faithfully
I remember a reference made
I remember an intimation
I remember full well
I remember the enjoyment with which
I remember the occasion perfectly
I remember to have heard
I repeat my statement in another form
I repeat, I am not speaking
I resent that kind of thing
I respect you for that
I respect your critical faculty
I respectfully counsel
I respectfully submit
I rest my opinion on
I return you my most grateful thanks
I return, in conclusion, to
I rise in behalf
I rise to express my disapprobation   
I rise to thank you
I rise with some trepidation
I said a little way back
I said it would be well
I said that I thought
I salute with profound reverence
I sanction with all my heart
I saw a face bloom like a flower
I saw a river of men marching like a tide
I saw an ingenious argument the other day
I saw his senses swim dizzy as clouds
I say frankly
I say in moderation
I say it in all modesty
I say it is extremely important
I say it most confidently
I say no more of these things
I say not one syllable against
I say this is no disparagement of
I say this the more gladly
I say without fear of contradiction
I say, then, my first point is
I see around me
I see as clearly as any man possibly can
I see disapproval in your face
I see it from a different angle
I see little hope of
I see no exception
I see no possibility of
I see no reason for doubting
I see you are an enthusiast
I see your point of view
I seem to have heard that sentiment before
I seem to hear you say
I seize upon this opportunity
I seriously desire
I set out with saying
I shall add a few words
I shall address myself to a single point
I shall ask you to look very closely
I shall at once proceed to forget it
I shall await your pleasure
I shall be glad if you will join me
I shall be interested to watch it develop
I shall be most proud and pleased
I shall be pleased to forward descriptive circulars
I shall be told
I shall best attain my object
I shall bestow a little attention upon
I shall certainly admit
I shall certainly take you at your word
I shall consider myself privileged
I shall desist from
I shall endeavor to be guided
I shall esteem it a personal favor
I shall feel highly honored
I shall give it in the words of
I shall here briefly recite the
I shall here use the word to denote
I shall hope to interest you
I shall invite you to follow me
I shall just give the summary of
I shall make a point of thinking so
I shall never believe
I shall never cease to be grateful
I shall never forget your kindness
I shall not acknowledge
I shall not attempt a detailed narrative
I shall not end without appealing
I shall not enlarge upon
I shall not force into the discussion
I shall not go so far as to say
I shall not hesitate to say something
I shall not tax your patience
I shall not undertake to prophesy
I shall not weary your patience
I shall now give you some instances
I shall now proceed to show
I shall often have to advert to
I shall pass by all this
I shall presently show
I shall proceed without further preface
I shall recur to certain questions
I shall respect your confidence
I shall say all this without entering into
I shall show that I am not
I shall speak first about
I shall speak with becoming frankness
I shall take a broader view of the subject
I shall take it for granted here
I shall therefore endeavor
I shall touch upon one or two questions
I shall waste no time in refuting
I shall with your sanction
I should appreciate your confidence greatly
I should be false to my own manhood
I should be surprised if
I should be the last man to deny
I should be very ungrateful were I not satisfied with it
I should fail in my duty if
I should feel unhappy if I did otherwise
I should find it hard to discover
I should have forfeited my own self-respect
I should like at least to mention
I should like to emphasize
I should like to go a step farther
I should like to refer to two events
I should like to see that view answered
I should like to-day to examine briefly
I should like your opinion of it
I should much prefer
I should not be satisfied with myself
I should not dream of asking you to do so
I should think it too absurd
I should think it very unlikely
I should welcome an interview at your convenience
I shrink from the contemplation
I shudder at the doctrine
I simply cannot endure it
I simply lay my finger on a fact
I simply pause here to ask
I sincerely hope that you will give the subject your earnest consideration
I sincerely regret the absence
I sincerely wish it were in my power
I solemnly declare
I sometimes hear a wish expressed
I sorrowfully call to mind
I speak forth my sentiment
I speak from no little personal observation
I speak of this to show
I speak the fact when I tell you
I speak the secret feeling of this company
I speak what I know when I say
I speak wholly without authority
I speak with feeling upon this point
I speak with some degree of encouragement
I speak with the utmost sincerity
I speak within the hearing of
I spoke only in jest
I stand corrected
I stand in awed amazement before
I stand in the midst of men
I still view with respect
I submit it to every candid mind
I submit that in such a case
I submit that it is high time
I submit this proposition
I suffered agonies of shyness
I summon you to do your share
I suppose I ought to feel flattered
I suppose it is right to answer
I suppose it to be entirely true
I suppose most men will recollect
I suppose that everyone who listens to me
I suppose there is no one here
I suppose we are all of one opinion
I surmised as much
I suspect that is why we so often
I sympathize deeply with you
I sympathize most heartily
I take a broader and bolder position
I take it for granted
I take leave to say
I take one picture as an illustration
I take pleasure in replying to your inquiry concerning
I take pleasure in saying
I take that for granted
I take the liberty of observing
I take this instance at random
I take two views of
I tell him in reply
I tell you, gentlemen
I tender my thanks to you
I thank you for having allowed me
I thank you for the appreciative tone
I thank you for the honor
I thank you for your most generous greeting
I thank you for your thoughtful courtesy
I thank you from the bottom of my heart
I thank you very gratefully
I thank you very sincerely for the honor
I think I am correct in saying
I think I am not the first to utter
I think I can answer that for you
I think I can claim a purpose
I think I can sincerely declare
I think I have a right to look upon
I think I have rightly spoken
I think I know what you are going to say
I think I might safely say
I think I need not say more
I think extremely well of it
I think he has very noble ideals
I think it has its charm
I think it is not too much to say
I think it is quite right
I think it is superb!
I think it may be necessary to consider
I think it might be said with safety
I think it my duty to
I think it observable
I think it probable
I think it quite admirable
I think it will astonish you
I think it will be granted
I think its tone is remarkably temperate
I think no Wise man can be indifferent
I think something may be said in favor of
I think that I can explain
I think that I can venture to say
I think that all will agree
I think that is rather a brilliant idea
I think that none of us will deny
I think that, in these last years
I think there is no better evidence
I think there is no call on me to listen
I think we are justified
I think we can hardly hope
I think we may all easily see
I think we may ask in reply
I think we may safely conclude
I think we may say, therefore
I think we may well be proud of
I think we may well congratulate each other
I think we must draw a distinction
I think we need neither doubt nor fear
I think we ought to recur a moment to
I think we shall all recognize
I think we should do well to call to mind
I think we take too narrow a view
I think what you say is reasonable
I think when we look back upon
I think you are quibbling
I think you are rather severe in your opinions
I think you have great appreciation of values
I think you have summed it up perfectly
I think you may well rejoice in
I think you will all agree
I think you will pardon my saying
I think you will see
I think your candor is charming
I think, on the contrary
I thoroughly agree with you
I thought it most amusing
I thought you were seriously indisposed
I thus explicitly reply
I took the good day from the hands of God as a perfect gift
I tremble at the task
I tremble to think
I trust I may be indulged
I trust I shall hear from you soon
I trust it is not presumptuous
I trust that I shall have the indulgence
I trust that as the years roll on
I trust that this will not be regarded as
I trust you will not consider it an impertinence
I turn, gentlemen, to the case
I understand exactly how you feel about it
I understand your delicacy of feeling
I use the word advisedly
I use the word in the sense
I use very plain language
I utter this word with the deepest affection
I value very much the honor
I venture to ask permission
I venture to propose another plan
I venture to say
I verily believe
I very confidently submit
I very rarely allow myself that pleasure
I view that prospect with the greatest misgiving
I wander'd lonely as a cloud
I want to bespeak your attention
I want to express the hope that
I want to have a frank understanding with you
I want to interest you
I want to know the character
I want to make some simple applications
I want to say just a few words
I want to say one word more
I want to say to you seriously
I want to thank you for your reply
I want to think with you
I warn and exhort you
I was as sensitive as a barometer
I was astonished to learn
I was at a loss to understand the reason for it
I was constantly watchful to
I was exceedingly interested
I was extremely perplexed
I was honored with the acquaintance
I was hoping that I could persuade you
I was in a somber mood
I was lost in admiration
I was no more than a straw on the torrent of his will
I was not slow to accept and believe
I was not without some anxiety
I was on the point of asking you
I was overshadowed by a deep boding
I was overwhelmed
I was piqued   
I was sincerely astonished
I was speaking generally
I was very much interested
I was very much thrilled
I watched you with admiration
I well recollect the time
I well remember an occasion
I will accept the general proposition
I will add the memorable words
I will answer you frankly
I will ask the indulgence
I will ask you to accompany me
I will ask you to bear witness
I will dwell a little longer
I will endeavor in a brief way
I will endeavor to illustrate
I will endeavor to show you
I will enlarge no further
I will even express a hope at the outset
I will even go further and say
I will face thy wrath though it bite as a sword
I will first call your attention to
I will give one more illustration
I will illustrate this point by
I will listen to no protestations
I will merely mention
I will neither affirm nor deny
I will not allude
I will not argue this
I will not attempt to note
I will not be content until
I will not condescend to
I will not enumerate at present
I will not pause to maintain
I will not positively say
I will not pretend to inquire into
I will not quarrel with
I will not relinquish the confidence
I will not repeat the arguments here
I will not try to gauge
I will now consider with you
I will now leave this question
I will now take an instance
I will only speak to one point
I will only sum up my evidence
I will only take an occasion to express
I will only venture to remind you
I will permit myself the liberty of saying
I will point out to your attention
I will say at once
I will speak but a word or two more
I will speak plainly
I will state with perfect distinctness
I will suppose the objection to be
I will take it only under compulsion
I will take one more instance
I will take the precaution to add
I will tell you what I think of
I will tell you what puzzles me
I will think of it, since you wish it
I will try to make the thing intelligible
I will venture a single remark
I will venture to add
I will venture to express the hope
I will yield the whole question
I will, with great pleasure
I willingly admit
I wish I could explain my point more fully
I wish I had the time and the power
I wish I knew what you meant by that
I wish also to declare positively
I wish at the outset
I wish emphatically to reaffirm
I wish it first observed
I wish rather to call your attention
I wish to ask if you honestly and candidly believe
I wish to be allowed to enforce in detail
I wish to be perfectly fair
I wish to begin my statement
I wish to confine what I have to say
I wish to confirm my letter
I wish to do full justice to
I wish to draw your attention
I wish to express my profound gratification
I wish to give these arguments their full weight
I wish to know whether
I wish to offer a few words relative to
I wish to put things as plainly as possible
I wish to remind you in how large a degree
I wish to say a word or two
I wish to state all this as a matter of fact
I wish you success and happiness
I wish you to observe
I wish, sir, that justice might be done
I wonder how much truth there is in it?
I wonder if you have the smallest recollection of me?
I would agree if I understood
I would also gratefully acknowledge
I would as soon believe
I would desire to speak simply and directly
I would enter a protest
I would fain believe                       
I would further point out to you
I would have you understand
I would infinitely rather
I would like to say one word just here
I would not be understood as belittling
I would not dwell upon that matter if
I would not push the suggestion so far
I would now gladly lay before you
I would rather a thousand times
I would recommend to your consideration
I would suggest first of all
I would that my voice could reach the ear
I would urge and entreat you
I would urge upon you
I would venture to point out
I wouldn't put it just that way
I yielded to the earnest solicitations
I yielded to the ingratiating mood of the day
I, for my part, would rather
I, for one, greatly doubt
Ideas which spread with the speed of light
Idle hopes, like empty shadows
If I am asked for the proof
If I am wrong
If I can be of further service, please address me
If I can carry you with me
If I can succeed in describing
If I could find words
If I have done no more than view the facts
If I have in any way deserved
If I may be allowed a little criticism
If I may be allowed modestly to suggest
If I may be allowed to refer
If I may reverently say so
If I may say so without presumption
If I may so speak
If I may take for granted
If I may venture to say anything
If I mistake not the sentiment
If I mistake not you were there once?
If I recollect aright
If I speak strongly, it is because I feel strongly
If I understand the matter at all
If I venture a few remarks
If I were asked
If I were disposed to offer counsel
If I were sure you would not misunderstand my meaning
If I were to act upon my conviction
If I were to recapitulate
If I wished to prove my contention
If any man be so persuaded
If any other answer be made
If anyone could conceive
If anyone is so dim of vision
If at first view this should seem
If ever I can repay it, command me
If in the glow of conscious pride
If in the years of the future
If it be difficult to appreciate
If it be so
If it be true
If it is contended
If it is not convenient for you
If it means anything, it means this
If more were needed to illustrate.
If my opinions are true
If on the contrary, we all foresee
If one seeks to measure
If only we go deep enough
If still you have further doubt
If the bare facts were studied
If the experience of the world is worth anything
If there be any among us
If there be one lesson more than another
If there is any valid reason why you are unable
If this be so
If this seems doubtful to anyone
If we accept at all the argument
If we are not blind to
If we are rightly informed
If we are to reason on the fact
If we can be of service to you
If we can help you in any way
If we cast our glance back
If we embark upon a career
If we had the whole case before us
If we have not made everything perfectly clear, please let us know
If we isolate ourselves
If we may trust to experience
If we pursue a different course
If we pursue our inquiries through
If we sincerely desire
If we survey
If we would not be beguiled
If what has been said is true
If you accommodate us, the favor will be greatly appreciated
If you are interested, please let us hear from you
If you are thinking about ordering
If you desire, our representative will call
If you don't mind my saying so
If you give this matter your prompt attention
If you have any cause for dissatisfaction
If you insist upon it
If you remain silent
If you seek the real meaning of
If you think for a moment
If you want to look
If you were asked to point out
If you will allow me to prophesy
If you will forgive me the expression
If you will pardon me the frankness
If you wish for a more interesting example
If you wish to get at the bottom of facts
If you would see the most conclusive proof
If your view is right
If, however, you determine to
If, in consequence we find it necessary
If, on the other hand, I say
If, then, I am asked
If, then, I should here rest my cause
If, unhappily, the day should ever come
Ill-bred insolence was his only weapon
Ill-dissimulated fits of ambition
Illuminate with sinister effect
Imbued with a vernal freshness       
Immediate and effectual steps
Immense and careless prodigality
Immense capacity for ceaseless progress
Immense objects which dwarf us
Immersed in secret schemes
Immunity from criticism and control
Immured in a trivial round of duty       
Impartial and exacting judgment
Impassioned and earnest language
Impassive as a statue
Impatience of despotic influence
Impatient and authoritative tones
Impatient as the wind
Impelled by strong conviction
Imperiled in a restless age
Imperious in its demands            
Impervious to the lessons of experience
Implying an immense melancholy
Impotent outbreaks of unreasoning rage
Impregnable as Gibraltar
Impressive as a warrant of arrest for high treason
Imprisoned within an enchanted circle
Impromptu parades of noisy patriotism
In a deprecating tone of apology
In a diversity of application
In a fever of apprehension
In a flash of revelation
In a frenzy of fussy excitement
In a frowning abstraction
In a gale of teasing merriment
In a great and fruitful way
In a high degree culpable
In a kind of confused astonishment
In a manner that sometimes terrifies me
In a misery of annoyance and mortification
In a most commendable fashion
In a most impressive vein
In a musing ecstasy of contemplation
In a position of undisputed supremacy
In a rapture of imagined ecstasy
In a secret and surreptitious way
In a significant paragraph
In a sky stained with purple, the moon slowly rose
In a spirit of friendliness and conciliation
In a spirit of indulgent irony
In a state of mulish reluctance      
In a state of nervous exacerbation
In a state of virtuous complacency
In a strain of exaggerated gallantry
In a tone of after-dinner perfunctoriness
In a tone of musing surprise
In a tone of uneasy interrogation
In a transport of ambitious vanity
In a tumult of self-approval and towering exultation
In a vague and fragmentary way
In a whirlwind of feeling and memory
In a wider sense
In a wise, superior, slightly scornful manner
In a word, I conceive
In a word, gentlemen
In accents embarrassed and hesitating
In accents of menace and wrath
In accordance with the terms of our offer
In accordance with your request
In actual life, I suspect
In addition to these arguments
In addressing myself to the question
In addressing you I feel
In agreement with this obvious conclusion
In all ages of the world
In all or any of these views
In all times and places
In alliance with steady clearness of intellect
In amazed ejaculation
In an eminent and unique sense
In an eminent degree
In an unguarded moment
In answering the inquiry
In answering your inquiry regarding
In any event, a reply to this will be very much appreciated
In any view of the case
In closing my speech, I ask each of you
In closing we can only assure you
In compliance with your favor
In compliance with your request, we are pleased to send to you
In conclusion, let me say
In conclusion, may I repeat
In conclusion, we can assure you
In consequence it becomes a necessity
In contemplating the causes
In days to come
In deference to a unanimous sentiment
In examining this part of the subject
In extenuation of the past
In fine, it is no extravagance to say
In former ages and generations
In further illustration
In further proof of my assertion
In high good humor
In his customary sententious fashion
In honor spotless as unfallen snow
In illustration of what I have said
In its most odious and intolerable shape
In its whole unwieldy compass
In language terse yet familiar
In like manner I would advise
In like manner are to be explained
In listening to the kind words
In looking about me
In many instances
In meeting this difficulty, I will not urge
In moments of swift and momentous decision
In moments of the most imminent peril
In most cases I hold
In my estimation
In my humble opinion
In my view
In offering to you these counsels
In one other respect
In one point I wish no one to mistake me
In one respect you are quite right
In one sense this is undoubtedly true
In order to appreciate the force of
In order to complete the proof
In order to do justice to the question
In order to facilitate our future transactions
In order to prove plainly and intelligibly
In order to realize adequately
In other words
In our estimate of the past
In point of fact
In precisely the same way
In pursuance of these views
In pursuing the great objects
In quest of something to amuse
In quite incredible confusion
In reference to your application
In regard to
In regard to your proposition
In reply thereto, we wish to inform you
In reply to your valued favor
In requital for various acts of rudeness
In response to your recent request
In rising to return my sincere thanks
In saying all of this, I do not forget
In saying this, I am not disposed to deny
In seasons of difficulty and trial
In short, I say
In solving this difficulty
In something of a parallel way
In spite of our best efforts it is not probable
In spite of plausible arguments
In spite of the fact
In such cases, strictly speaking
In support of this assertion
In terms of imperishable beauty
In thanking you for the patronage with which you have favored us
In that case let me rob you of a few minutes
In that head of his a flame burnt that was like an altar-fire
In that matchless epitome
In that mood of high hope
In the air was the tang of spring
In the anomalies of fortune
In the course of these remarks
In the dim procession of years
In the dusky path of a dream
In the existing circumstances
In the face of smarting disillusions
In the first place we see
In the first place, therefore, I consider
In the first place, we should be all agreed
In the flush and heyday of youth and gaiety and loveliness
In the fullest sense
In the fullness of time
In the heyday of friendship
In the highest conceivable degree
In the last suggestion
In the local phrase
In the meantime I will commend to you
In the mild and mellow maturity of age
In the nature of things
In the next place, be assured
In the ordinarily accepted sense
In the perpetual presence of everlasting verities
In the presence of this vast assembly
In the present situation
In the progress of events
In the realm of conjecture
In the remarks I have made
In the same manner I rely
In the scheme of things
In the second place it is quite clear
In the suggestion I have made
In the tone of one who moralizes
In the twinkling of an eye
In the very brief space at our disposal
In the world of letters
In these extraordinary circumstances
In these sentiments I agree
In this breathless chase of pleasure
In this brief survey
In this chastened mood I left him
In this connection I remind myself
In this connection, I may be permitted to refer
In this necessarily brief and imperfect review
In this rapid and slight enumeration
In this respect
In this sense only
In this there is no contradiction
In tones of genuine admiration
In very many instances
In very truth
In view of all these facts, we feel justified in claiming
In view of these reflections
In what I have now further to say
In what case, for example?
In what has now been said
In widening our view
In yonder cottage shines a light, far-gleaming like a gem
Incapable of flashy make-believe
Incapable of initiative or boldness
Incited by a lust for gain
Incomparable lucidity and penetrativeness
Inconceivable clumsiness of organization
Inconceivable perversion of reasoning
Incredible as it sounds, I had for a moment forgotten
Incredible little white teeth, like snow shut in a rose
Indeed we know
Indeed! How?
Indeed, I am not convinced
Indeed, I can not do better
Indeed, I have heard it whispered
Indeed, I may fairly say
Indeed, but it is quite possible
Indeed, can anyone tell me
Indeed, it will generally be found
Indeed, you are wholly wrong
Indifferently so, I am afraid
Indolently handsome eyes
Indulge a train of gentle recollection
Indulge in pleasing discursiveness
Indulging a sickly and nauseating petulance
Ineffable sensation of irritability
Ineffably dreary and unpicturesque
Infantile insensibility to the solemnity of his bereavement
Infantine simplicity and lavish waste
Infected with a feverish dissatisfaction
Information has just reached me
Infrequent carriages sped like mechanical toys guided by manikins
Infuse a wholesome terror
Inimical to true and determined principle   
Inimitable grace and felicity   
Injudicious and inelegant ostentation
Innumerable and incessant creations
Innumerable starlings clove the air        
Inordinate greed and love of wealth
Insatiably greedy of recognition
Insensibility to moral perspective and proportion
Insensible to its subtle influence
Insolent and riotous excess
Inspired by a vague malevolence
Inspired by the immortal flame of youth
Inspirited by approval and applause
Instances abound
Instances might be multiplied indefinitely
Instantly alive to the slightest breach of decorum
Instantly she revived like flowers in water
Insufferable violence to the feelings
Intangible and indescribable essence
Intangible as a dream
Intense and stubborn dogmatism
Intense love of excitement and adventure
Intense sensitiveness to injustice
Intercourse with polished society
Intervals of respite and repose
Intimations of unpenetrated mysteries
Into her eyes had come a hostile challenge
Into the purple sea the orange hues of heaven sunk silently
Into the very vestibule of death
Inveigh against established customs
Invested with a partial authority
Inveterate forces of opposition
Invincible jealousy and hate
Involuntarily she sighed
Involuntary awkwardness and reserve
Involuntary thrill of gratified vanity
Involved in a labyrinth of perplexities
Involved in profound uncertainty
Involving ourselves in embarrassments
Inward appraisal and self-renouncement
Irony was ten thousand leagues from my intention
Irregulated and desultory education     
Irrelevant to the main issue
Irresistibly impelled by conscience
Irritable bitterness and angry suspicion
Is it logically consistent
Is it not legitimate to recognize
Is it not marvelous
Is it not obvious
Is it not quite possible
Is it not universally recognized
Is it not wise to argue
Is it not, then, preposterous
Is it possible, can it be believed
Is it sane--is it reasonable?
Is it, then, any wonder
Is not that the common sentiment
Is that a fair question?
Is there any evidence here
Is there any language of reproach
Is there any possibility of mistaking
Is there any reason in the world
Isn't it amazing?
Isn't it extraordinarily funny?
Isn't it preposterous?
Isn't that a trifle unreasonable?
Isn't that rather a hasty conclusion?
It affords me gratification
It also pleases me very much
It always seemed to me impossible
It amounts to this
It amuses you, doesn't it?
It appears from what has been said
It appears to me, on the contrary
It assumes the shape of malignity
It betrays a great want of prudence and discernment
It blunts the sensibilities
It came and faded like a wreath of mist at eve
It came to him with a stab of enlightenment
It can rightly be said
It certainly follows, then
It comes to this
It could never conceivably be anything but popular
It could not be otherwise
It cuts like knives, this air so chill
It defies description
It depends on how you look at it
It depends upon circumstances
It dissipates every doubt and scruple
It does not necessarily follow
It doesn't sound plausible to me
It drops away like water from a smooth statue
It elicited a remarkably clear and coherent statement
It enslaves the imagination
It exhibits a state of mind
It extorted from him expressions of irritability
It follows as a matter of course
It follows inevitably
It gives one a little grip at the throat
It gives us an exalted conception
It gives us pleasure to recommend
It grieves me to relate
It hardly fits the character
It has a lovely situation as I remember it
It has amused me hugely
It has at all times been a just reproach
It has been a relief to talk to you
It has been a very great pleasure for me
It has been an immense privilege to see you
It has been generally assumed
It has been justly objected
It has been my privilege
It has been stigmatized as irrelevant
It has been suggested fancifully
It has been well said
It has consistently been our aim to help our customers
It has ever been my ambition
It has more than passing interest
It has never occurred to me
It has seldom been surpassed
It has struck me very forcibly
It imposes no constraint
It is I who should ask forgiveness
It is a capital blunder
It is a circumstance of happy augury
It is a common error
It is a common error among ignorant people
It is a consoling reflection
It is a curious fact
It is a curious trait
It is a fact well known
It is a falsehood to say
It is a familiar charge against
It is a flight beyond the reach of human magnanimity
It is a good augury of success  
It is a great pleasure to me
It is a great pleasure to meet you
It is a huge undertaking
It is a living truth
It is a mark of great instability
It is a matter of absorbing interest
It is a matter of amusement
It is a matter of fact
It is a matter of great regret to us
It is a matter of just pride
It is a melancholy story
It is a memory I cherish
It is a mischievous notion
It is a mistake to suppose
It is a most extraordinary thing
It is a most pertinent question
It is a most unfortunate affair
It is a noble thing
It is a peculiar pleasure to me
It is a perfectly plain proposition
It is a perversion of terms
It is a pleasing peculiarity
It is a pleasure for me to answer your inquiry
It is a popular idea
It is a rare privilege
It is a rather melancholy thought
It is a recognized principle
It is a remarkable and striking fact
It is a staggering thought
It is a strange fact
It is a sure sign
It is a theme too familiar
It is a thing commonly said
It is a thing infinitely subtle
It is a touching reflection
It is a true saying
It is a truth universally acknowledged
It is a very significant fact
It is a vision which still inspires us
It is a well known fact
It is a wholesome symptom
It is all very fine to think
It is all very inexcusable
It is all very well for you to be philosophical
It is all very well to say
It is almost proverbial
It is also possible
It is also probably true
It is altogether probable
It is always pleasant to respond
It is always something vicious
It is amazing how little
It is an admirable way of putting it
It is an easy matter
It is an egregious mistake
It is an error of taste
It is an established rule
It is an extreme case, but the principle is sound
It is an incredible thing
It is an ingenious theory
It is an interesting fact
It is an intolerable idea
It is an odd jealousy
It is an uncommonly fine description
It is an unforgivable offense
It is an unquestionable truth
It is appropriate that we should celebrate
It is asserted
It is assumed as an axiom
It is at once inconsistent
It is but fair to say
It is but too true
It is by no means my design
It is certainly especially pleasant
It is certainly remarkable
It is common in these days to lament
It is commonly assumed
It is comparatively easy
It is curious sophistry
It is curious to observe
It is desirable for us
It is difficult for me to respond fitly
It is difficult to avoid saying
It is difficult to describe
It is difficult to overstate
It is difficult to put a limit
It is difficult to surmise
It is doubtful whether
It is easy enough to add
It is easy to instance cases
It is easy to understand
It is eminently proper
It is every man's duty to think
It is evident that the answer to this
It is evidently supposed by many people
It is exceedingly gratifying to hear
It is exceedingly unfortunate
It is extremely interesting, I can assure you
It is fair that you should hear
It is fair to suppose
It is far from me to desire
It is fatal to suppose
It is fitting
It is for me to relate
It is for others to illustrate
It is for this reason
It is for us to ask
It is for you to decide
It is gratifying to have the honor
It is greatly assumed
It is hardly for me
It is hardly necessary to pass judgment
It is historically true
It is idle to think of
It is immaterial whether
It is impossible to avoid saying
It is impossible to resist acknowledging this
It is in every way appropriate
It is in the highest degree worthy
It is in this characteristic
It is in vain
It is in your power to give
It is incredible!
It is indeed a strange doctrine
It is indeed generous of you to suggest it
It is indeed not a little remarkable
It is indeed true
It is indeed very clear
It is indispensable to have
It is inexplicable
It is interesting and suggestive
It is interesting to know
It is interesting to note
It is interesting, as a theory
It is just so far true
It is likewise necessary
It is literally impossible
It is little more than a platitude
It is made evident
It is manifest
It is manifestly absurd to say
It is merely a mood
It is merely common sense to say
It is more than probable
It is most unfortunate
It is my agreeable duty
It is my belief
It is my deliberately formed opinion
It is my earnest wish
It is my grateful duty to address you
It is my hope
It is my opinion you are too conscientious
It is my present purpose
It is natural to ask the question
It is necessary to refer
It is necessary to take some notice
It is needful to a complete understanding
It is needless before this audience to repeat
It is nevertheless true
It is no doubt true
It is no exaggeration to say
It is no part of my business
It is no significant thing
It is no small indication
It is no wonder
It is not a matter of the slightest consequence
It is not a practical question
It is not altogether satisfactory
It is not always fair to judge by appearances
It is not an unknown occurrence
It is not by any means
It is not consistent with elevated and dignified character
It is not difficult to comprehend
It is not difficult to discern
It is not easy for me to find words
It is not enough to say
It is not entirely clear to me
It is not every wind that can blow you from your anchorage
It is not evident
It is not for me on this occasion
It is not given to many men
It is not likely that any of you
It is not logical to say
It is not my intention to enter into
It is not my purpose to discuss
It is not necessarily true
It is not necessary for me even to sketch
It is not necessary for our purpose
It is not often in these modern days
It is not ours to pronounce
It is not out of place to remind you
It is not possible to recount
It is not quite clear
It is not so unreasonable as you think
It is not to me so very surprising
It is not too much to say
It is not unknown to you
It is not wholly insignificant
It is not within the scope of this address
It is notoriously easy to exaggerate
It is now high time for me
It is now perfectly plain
It is observable enough
It is obvious
It is of course difficult
It is of great importance to show
It is of no moment
It is of very little importance
It is often remarked
It is often very misleading
It is on these grounds
It is one of the burning questions of the day
It is one of the grave problems of the day
It is one of the most natural visions
It is one of the most significant things
It is one of the queerest freaks of fate
It is only a fancy of mine
It is only a few short years since
It is only just to say
It is our duty to examine
It is our very great pleasure to advise you
It is ours to bear witness
It is owing to this truth
It is peculiarly befitting at this time
It is perfectly apparent
It is perfectly defensible
It is perfectly trite
It is permissible to gratify such an impulse
It is pitiable to reflect
It is pleasant to meet this brilliant company
It is possible, but I rather doubt it
It is quite an easy matter
It is quite conceivable
It is quite too absurd
It is rather a pleasant coincidence
It is rather an arduous task
It is rather startling
It is rather startling
It is really impressive
It is really most callous of you to laugh
It is related
It is ridiculous to say
It is said to be impossible
It is said, and I think said truly
It is satisfactory to notice
It is scarcely necessary to insist
It is scarcely questioned
It is self-evident
It is sheer madness
It is sickening and so insufferably arrogant
It is simply a coincidence
It is sometimes hard to determine
It is still an open question
It is still more surprising
It is substantially true
It is surely necessary for me
It is the clear duty of
It is the common consent of men
It is the doctrine of
It is the fashion to extol
It is the most incomprehensible thing in the world
It is the policy of our house
It is the universal testimony
It is therefore evident
It is therefore necessary
It is this which lies at the foundation
It is to be expected
It is to be remembered
It is to me a very sincere satisfaction
It is to you that I am indebted for all this
It is told traditionally
It is too plain to be argued
It is true
It is true none the less
It is true, I am grieved to say
It is unnecessary for me to remind you
It is unnecessary to multiply instances
It is upon this line of reasoning
It is very amusing
It is very common to confuse
It is very doubtful whether
It is very far from being a fiction
It is very good of you to do this for my pleasure
It is very ingenious
It is very interesting and pleasant
It is very splendid of you
It is wanton capriciousness
It is well known
It is with great pleasure
It is with pity unspeakable
It is within the memory of men now living
It is worth while to notice
It is your privilege to think so
It is, all things considered, a fact
It lends no dazzling tints to fancy
It makes it all quite interesting
It makes life insupportable
It may appear absurd
It may at first sight seem strange
It may be added
It may be conjectured
It may be imagined
It may be plausibly objected
It may be rightly said
It may be useful to trace
It may be worth your while to keep in view
It may indeed be unavoidable
It may not be altogether certain
It may not be uninteresting to any of you
It may or may not be true
It may seem a little strange
It may sound strange to you
It may still more probably be said
It may, perhaps, seem wonderful
It moved me to a strange exhilaration
It must be a cause of delight
It must be a matter of conjecture
It must be a trifle dull at times
It must be borne in mind
It must be fascinating
It must be the verdict of history
It must be very gratifying to you
It must create astonishment
It must doubtless be admitted
It must ever be recollected
It must have been rather embarrassing
It must never be forgotten
It must not be supposed
It must seem to every thoughtful man
It needs scarcely be said
It now becomes my pride and privilege
It occasions suspicion and discontent
It only remains now to speak
It ought to animate us
It parted to a liquid horizon and showed the gray rim of the sea
It pealed through her brain like a muffled bell
It poured upon her like a trembling flood
It proved a bitter disillusion
It proves a great deal
It racked his ears like an explosion of steam-whistles
It ran as clear as a trout-brook
It remains only to speak briefly
It remains that I inform you of
It remains that I should say a few words
It reminds me of an anecdote
It reminds one of the compliment
It requires no effort of imagination
It runs counter to all established customs
It scarcely seems to be in keeping
It seemed intolerably tragic
It seemed to exhale a silent and calm authority
It seems almost desperate to think of
It seems almost incredible
It seems an age since we've last seen you
It seems as motionless and still as the zenith in the skies
It seems clear that our letter must have miscarried
It seems entirely wonderful to me
It seems incredible
It seems like a distracting dream
It seems now to be generally admitted
It seems preposterous
It seems strange to be told
It seems the height of absurdity
It seems then that on the whole
It seems to me a striking circumstance
It seems to me idle to ask
It seems to me singularly appropriate
It seems to me that you have a perfect right to do so
It seems to me the primary foundation
It seems to me unphilosophical
It seems unspeakably funny to me
It seems very ridiculous
It set his memories humming like a hive of bees
It shall be as you wish
It should always be borne in mind
It should be remembered
It should not be objectionable
It so happens
It sometimes seems to me
It sounds plausible
It sounds profoundly interesting
It sounds rather appalling
It sounds very alluring
It staggered the eye, like the sight of water running up hill
It still remains to be observed
It strikes me as rather pathetic
It strikes me with wonder
It stung like a frozen lash
It suggests at the outset
It summons our imagination
It surely is not too much to expect
It therefore astonishes me
It used to be a reproach
It was a breathless night of suspense
It was a brilliant answer
It was a desolating vision
It was a fine and delicate rebuke
It was a fit and beautiful circumstance
It was a matter of notoriety
It was a night of little ease to his toiling mind
It was a night of stupefying surprises
It was a propitious circumstance    
It was all infinitely soft and refreshing to the eye
It was an evening of great silences and spaces, wholly tranquil
It was an unpardonable liberty
It was as futile as to oppose an earthquake with argument
It was as if a door had been opened into a furnace, so the eyes blazed
It was certainly a gracious act
It was in the full understanding
It was inevitable that you should say that
It was most stupid of me to have forgotten it
It was my good fortune
It was not to be expected
It was not unkindly meant
It was peculiarly unfortunate
It was purely an oversight on our part
It was really an extraordinary experience
It was said by one who ought to know
It was sheer, exuberant, instinctive, unreasoning, careless joy
It was so incredible
It was the ecstasy and festival of summer
It was the most amazing thing I ever heard
It was torture of the most exquisite kind
It was under these circumstances
It was very good of you to come out and join us
It was, therefore, inevitable
It wears a ragged and dangerous front
It will appeal to
It will appear from what has been said
It will be asked me how
It will be easy to say too much
It will be easy to trace the influence
It will be entirely satisfactory to us
It will be evident to you
It will be idle to imply
It will be interesting to trace
It will be just as reasonable to say
It will be our aim to interest you
It will be rather to our advantage
It will be readily appreciated
It will be recollected
It will be seen at a glance
It will be to your advantage
It will be well and wise
It will carry out my meaning more fully
It will create a considerable sensation
It will divert your thoughts from a mournful subject
It will doubtless be more convenient for you
It will give me pleasure to do it
It will interest you to know
It will not alter my determination
It will not be expected from me
It will not be safe
It will not do for a man to say
It will not surely be objected
It will not take many words to sum up
It will not, I trust, be concluded
It will receive the same careful attention
It will thus be seen
It will, I suppose, be denied
It would be a fruitless and unthankful task
It would be a misfortune
It would be a proud distinction
It would be a very remarkable fact
It would be absurd to pretend
It would be an inexcusable omission
It would be idle for me
It would be ill-advised
It would be imprudent in me
It would be invidious for me   
It would be natural on such an occasion
It would be no less impracticable
It would be out of place here
It would be preposterous to say
It would be presumptuous in me
It would be superfluous to say
It would be the height of absurdity
It would be unfair to praise
It would be unjust to deny
It would be well for us to reflect
It would collapse as if by enchantment
It would indeed be unworthy
It would interest me very much
It would not seem an improbable conclusion
It would seem perhaps most fitting
It would seem to be a wise decision
It would take too long to formulate my thought
It's a difficult and delicate matter to discuss
It's a matter of immediate urgency
It's absolute folly
It's absurd--it's impossible
It's all nonsense
It's as logical as it can be under the circumstances
It's been a strange experience for you
It's deliciously honest
It's going to be rather troublesome
It's inconceivable that it should ever be necessary
It's mere pride of opinion
It's my chief form of recreation
It's not a matter of vast importance
It's past my comprehension
It's quite wonderful how logical and simple you make it
It's really very perplexing
It's so charming of you to say that
It's so kind of you to come
It's such a bore having to talk about it
It's the natural sequence
It's too melancholy
It's very wonderful
Its dominating and inspiring influence
Its temples and its palaces did seem
Jealous and formidable foes
Jealousies and animosities which pricked their sluggish blood to tingling
Jealousy, fierce as the fires
Join us, please, when you have time
Joy rioted in his large dark eyes
Judging without waiting to ponder over bulky tomes
Just mail the enclosed card
Just the reverse is true
Just trust to the inspiration of the moment
Justifiable in certain exigencies   
Justify it if you can
Keen power of calculation and unhesitating audacity
Kind of unscrupulous contempt for gravity
Kindle like an angel's wings the western skies in flame
Kindle the flames of genuine oratory
Kindly endorse your reply on the enclosed sheet
Kindly let us have your confirmation at your earliest convenience
Kindly let us know your pleasure concerning
Kindly mornings when autumn and winter
Kindly read the enclosed list
Kingdoms melt away like snow
Kiss-provoking lips
Knotty and subtle disquisitions      
Labored and far-fetched elocution
Laboring like a giant
Laden with the poignant scent of the garden honeysuckle
Laid down in a most unflinching and vigorous fashion
Lamentable instances of extravagance
Language is inadequate to voice my appreciation
Language of excessive flattery and adulation
Languid streams that cross softly, slowly,
Lapped in soft music of adulation
Lapse into pathos and absurdity
Large, dark, luminous eyes that behold everything about them
Lash themselves into fury
Lastly, I do not understand
Lastly, it can not be denied
Latent vein of whimsical humor
Laughter like a beautiful bubble from the rosebud of baby-hood
Laughter like the sudden outburst of the glad bird in the tree-top
Lax theories and corresponding practises
Lay hold of the affections
Lazy merchantmen that crawled like flies over the blue enamel of the sea
Lead to the strangest aberrations
Leaden mood of dulness
Leaping from lambent flame into eager and passionate fire
Leapt like a hunted stag
Leave to the imagination the endless vista of possibilities
Lend a critical ear
Less than this could not be said
Lest I should be accused of quibbling
Lest the requirements of courtesy be disregarded
Let all of us labor in this work
Let anyone imagine to himself
Let anyone who doubts
Let everyone consider
Let his frolic fancy play, like a happy child
Let in confusion like a whirling flood
Let it be clearly understood, I repeat it
Let it be remembered
Let it not be objected
Let it not be supposed that I impute
Let me add another thing
Let me add my final word
Let me add one other hint
Let me also say a word in regard
Let me answer these questions
Let me ask you to imagine
Let me ask your leave to propose
Let me be allowed to devote a few words
Let me call attention to another fact
Let me commend to you
Let me direct your attention now to
Let me entreat you to examine
Let me give one more instance
Let me give one parting word
Let me give you an illustration
Let me here make one remark
Let me here say
Let me hope that I have said enough
Let me illustrate again
Let me make myself distinctly understood
Let me make use of an illustration
Let me not be thought offensive
Let me now conclude with
Let me once more urge upon you
Let me persuade you
Let me protest against the manner
Let me quite temperately defend
Let me rather make the supposition
Let me say a practical word
Let me say how deeply indebted I feel for your kindness
Let me simply declare
Let me speak frankly
Let me tell you an interesting reminiscence
Let me thank you for the opportunity
Let me thank you once more
Let me urge you earnestly
Let no man congratulate himself
Let our conception be enlarged
Let our object be
Let that question be answered by
Let the facts be granted
Let these instances suffice
Let this be the record made
Let this inspire us with abhorrence of
Let thy mouth murmur like the doves
Let us approach the subject from another side
Let us assure you of our desire to cooperate with you
Let us assure you that we are very much pleased
Let us attempt a survey
Let us be perfectly just
Let us be quite practical
Let us bear perpetually in mind
Let us begin at the beginning
Let us begin by examining
Let us briefly review
Let us brush aside once for all
Let us cherish
Let us confirm our opinion
Let us consider for a moment
Let us devote ourselves
Let us discard all prejudice
Let us do all we can
Let us draw an illustration
Let us endeavor to understand
Let us enumerate
Let us figure to ourselves
Let us for the moment put aside
Let us get a clear understanding
Let us grant that for the sake of the argument
Let us heed the voice
Let us hope and believe
Let us hope that future generations
Let us imitate
Let us inquire also
Let us know if there is any further attention
Let us labor and pray
Let us likewise remember
Let us look briefly at a few particulars
Let us look nearer home
Let us not be fearful
Let us not be misled
Let us not be misunderstood
Let us not flatter ourselves
Let us not for a moment forget
Let us not limit our view
Let us now apply the views presented
Let us now consider the characteristics
Let us now see the results
Let us now turn our consideration
Let us observe this analogy
Let us pass on to another fact
Let us pause a moment
Let us push the inquiry yet further
Let us rather listen to
Let us reflect how vain
Let us remember this
Let us remind ourselves
Let us resolve
Let us scrutinize the facts
Let us suppose the case to be
Let us suppose, for argument's sake
Let us take a concrete instance
Let us take, for instance
Let us thank you again for opening an account with us
Let us try to form a mental picture
Let us turn to the contemplation of
Let us, then, be assured
Let us, then, be worthy of
Let us, therefore, say once for all
Let your imagination realize
Life flowed in its accustomed stream
Life had been arrested, as the horologist,
Life stretched before him alluring and various as the open road
Life sweet as perfume and pure as prayer
Light as a snowflake
Lights and shadows of reviving memory crossed her face
Lights gleamed there like stars in a still sky
Like Death, who rides upon a thought,
Like Heaven's free breath, which he who grasps can hold not
Like a ball of ice it glittered in a frozen sea of sky
Like a blade sent home to its scabbard
Like a blast from a horn
Like a blast from the suddenly opened door of a furnace
Like a blossom blown before a breeze,
Like a bright window in a distant view
Like a caged lion shaking the bars of his prison
Like a calm flock of silver-fleeced sheep
Like a cloud of fire
Like a cold wind his words went through their flesh
Like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue
Like a damp-handed auctioneer
Like a deaf and dumb man wondering what it was all about
Like a dew-drop, ill-fitted to sustain unkindly shocks
Like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the storm
Like a distant star glimmering steadily in the darkness
Like a dream she vanished
Like a festooned girdle encircling the waist of a bride
Like a flower her red lips parted
Like a game in which the important part is to keep from laughing
Like a glow-worm golden
Like a golden-shielded army
Like a great express train, roaring, flashing, dashing head-long
Like a great fragment of the dawn it lay
Like a great ring of pure and endless light
Like a great tune to which the planets roll
Like a high and radiant ocean
Like a high-born maiden
Like a jewel every cottage casement showed
Like a joyless eye that finds no object worth its constancy
Like a knight worn out by conflict
Like a knot of daisies lay the hamlets on the hill
Like a lily in bloom
Like a living meteor
Like a locomotive-engine with unsound lungs
Like a long arrow through the dark the train is darting
Like a mirage, vague, dimly seen at first
Like a miser who spoils his coat with scanting a little cloth
Like a mist the music drifted from the silvery strings
Like a moral lighthouse in the midst of a dark and troubled sea
Like a murmur of the wind came a gentle sound of stillness
Like a noisy argument in a drawing-room
Like a pageant of the Golden Year, in rich memorial pomp the hours go by
Like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherished
Like a poet hidden
Like a river of molten amethyst
Like a rocket discharging a shower of golden stars
Like a rose embower'd in its own green leaves
Like a sea of upturned faces
Like a shadow never to be overtaken
Like a shadow on a fair sunlit landscape
Like a sheeted ghost
Like a ship tossed to and fro on the waves of life's sea
Like a slim bronze statue of Despair
Like a snow-flake lost in the ocean
Like a soul that wavers in the Valley of the Shadow
Like a stalled horse that breaks loose
Like a star that dwelt apart
Like a star, his love's pure face looked down
Like a star, unhasting, unresting
Like a stone thrown at random
Like a summer cloud, youth indeed has crept away
Like a summer-dried fountain
Like a swift eagle in the morning glare
Like a thing at rest
Like a thing read in a book or remembered out of the faraway past
Like a tide of triumph through their veins,
Like a triumphing fire the news was borne
Like a troop of boys let loose from school, the adventurers went by
Like a vaporous amethyst
Like a vision of the morning air
Like a voice from the unknown regions
Like a wandering star I fell through the deeps of desire
Like a watch-worn and weary sentinel
Like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed
Like a whirlwind they went past
Like a withered leaf the moon is blown across the bay
Like a world of sunshine
Like a yellow silken scarf the thick fog hangs
Like all citizens of high ideals
Like an alien ghost I stole away
Like an eagle clutching his prey, his arm swooped down
Like an eagle dallying with the wind
Like an engine of dread war, he set his shoulder to the mountain-side
Like an enraged tiger
Like an enthusiast leading about with him an indifferent tourist
Like an icy wave, a swift and tragic impression swept through him
Like an unbidden guest
Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun
Like an unseen star of birth
Like an unwelcome thought
Like apparitions seen and gone
Like attempting to number the waves on the snore of a limitless sea
Like bells that waste the moments with their loudness
Like blasts of trumpets blown in wars
Like bright Apollo
Like bright lamps, the fabled apples glow
Like building castles in the air
Like bursting waves from the ocean
Like cliffs which have been rent asunder
Like clouds of gnats with perfect lineaments
Like cobwebs woven round the limbs of an infant giant
Like crystals of snow
Like dead lovers who died true
Like dew upon a sleeping flower
Like dining with a ghost
Like drawing nectar in a sieve
Like earth's decaying leaves
Like echoes from a hidden lyre
Like echoes from an antenatal dream
Like fixed eyes, whence the dear light of sense and thought has fled
Like footsteps upon wool
Like fragrance from dead flowers
Like ghosts the sentries come and go
Like ghosts, from an enchanter fleeing
Like golden boats on a sunny sea
Like great black birds, the demons haunt the woods
Like green waves on the sea
Like having to taste a hundred exquisite dishes in a single meal
Like helpless birds in the warm nest
Like iridescent bubbles floating on a foul stream
Like kindred drops mingled into one
Like laying a burden on the back of a moth
Like lead his feet were
Like leaves in wintry weather
Like leviathans afloat
Like lighting a candle to the sun
Like making a mountain out of a mole-hill
Like mariners pulling the life-boat
Like mice that steal in and out as if they feared the light
Like mountain over mountain huddled
Like mountain streams we meet and part
Like music on the water
Like notes which die when born, but still haunt the echoes of the hill
Like oceans of liquid silver
Like one pale star against the dusk,
Like one who halts with tired wings
Like one who talks of what he loves in dream
Like organ music came the deep reply
Like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream
Like phantoms gathered by the sick imagination
Like planets in the sky
Like pouring oil on troubled waters
Like roses that in deserts bloom and die
Like rowing upstream against a strong downward current
Like scents from a twilight garden
Like separated souls
Like serpents struggling in a vulture's grasp
Like sheep from out the fold of the sky, stars leapt
Like ships that have gone down at sea
Like shy elves hiding from the traveler's eye
Like skeletons, the sycamores uplift their wasted hands
Like some grave night thought threading a dream
Like some new-gathered snowy hyacinth,
Like some poor nigh-related guest, that may not rudely be dismist
Like some suppressed and hideous thought which flits athwart our musings,
Like some unshriven churchyard thing, the friar crawled
Like something fashioned in a dream
Like sounds of wind and flood
Like splendor-winged moths about a taper
Like stepping out on summer evenings from the glaring ball-room
Like straws in a gust of wind
Like summer's beam and summer's stream
Like sunlight, in and out the leaves, the robins went
Like sweet thoughts in a dream
Like the Spring-time, fresh and green
Like the awful shadow of some unseen power
Like the bellowing of bulls
Like the boar encircled by hunters and hounds
Like the bubbles on a river sparkling, bursting, borne away
Like the cold breath of the grave
Like the creaking of doors held stealthily ajar
Like the cry of an itinerant vendor in a quiet and picturesque town
Like the dance of some gay sunbeam
Like the dawn of the morn
Like the detestable and spidery araucaria
Like the dew on the mountain
Like the dim scent in violets
Like the drifting foam of a restless sea
Like the embodiment of a perfect rose, complete in form and fragrance
Like the faint cry of unassisted woe
Like the faint exquisite music of a dream
Like the fair flower dishevel'd in the wind
Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array he cheers the morn,
Like the falling thud of the blade of a murderous ax
Like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream
Like the fitting of an old glove to a hand
Like the foam on the river
Like the great thunder sounding
Like the jangling of all the strings of some musical instrument
Like the jewels that gleam in baby eyes
Like the kiss of maiden love the breeze is sweet and bland
Like the long wandering love, the weary heart may faint for rest
Like the moon in water seen by night
Like the music in the patter of small feet
Like the prodigal whom wealth softens into imbecility
Like the quivering image of a landscape in a flowing stream
Like the rainbow, thou didst fade
Like the rustling of grain moved by the west-wind
Like the sap that turns to nectar, in the velvet of the peach
Like the sea whose waves are set in motion by the winds
Like the sea-worm, that perforates the shell of the mussel,
Like the setting of a tropical sun
Like the shadow of a great hill that reaches far out over the plain
Like the shadows of the stars in the upheaved sea
Like the shudder of a doomed soul
Like the silver gleam when the poplar trees
Like the soft light of an autumnal day
Like the stern-lights of a ship at sea,
Like the sudden impulse of a madman
Like the swell of Summer's ocean
Like the tattered effigy in a cornfield
Like the vase in which roses have once been distill'd
Like the visits of angels, short and far between
Like the whole sky when to the east the morning doth return
Like thistles of the wilderness, fit neither for food nor fuel
Like those great rivers, whose course everyone beholds,
Like thoughts whose very sweetness
Like to diamonds her white teeth shone between the parted lips
Like torrents from a mountain source, we rushed into each other's arms
Like troops of ghosts on the dry wind past
Like two doves with silvery wings, let our souls fly
Like two flaming stars were his eyes
Like vaporous shapes half seen
Like village curs that bark when their fellows do
Like wasted hours of youth
Like winds that bear sweet music,
Like wine-stain to a flask the old distrust still clings
Like winged stars the fire-flies flash and glance
Like young lovers whom youth and love make dear
Likely enough
Lingering like an unloved guest
Links in the chain of reasoning
Lionized by fashionable society
Lithe as a panther
Little less than scandalous
Little white hands like pearls
Little wonder therefore
Lofty and distinguished simplicity
Lofty as a queen
Loneliness struck him like a blow
Long have I been convinced
Long intertangled lines of silver streamlets
Long-sighted continuity of thought and plan
Look at it in another way
Look at some of these questions
Look at the situation
Looked back with faithful eyes like a great mastiff to his master's face
Looking as sulky as the weather itself
Looking at the matter by and large
Looking forward to the early receipt of some of your orders
Looking like a snarling beast baulked of its prey
Looming large and ugly in the public view
Loose and otiose statement       
Loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed
Lost in a delirious wonder
Lost in indolent content
Lost in irritable reflection
Lost like the lightning in the sullen clod
Love as clean as starlight
Love brilliant as the morning
Love had like the canker-worm consumed her early prime
Love hovered in her gaze
Love is a changing lord as the light on a turning sword
Love like a child around the world doth run
Love like a miser in the dark his joys would hide
Love shakes like a windy reed your heart
Love smiled like an unclouded sun
Love that sings and has wings as a bird
Lovely as starry water
Lovely beyond all words
Lovely the land unknown and like a river flowing
Lucidity and argumentative vigor
Ludicrous attempts of clumsy playfulness and tawdry eloquence
Luke-warm assurance of continued love
Lulled by dreamy musings
Lulled into a sense of false satisfaction
Luminous with great thoughts
Maddened by a jealous hate
Magnanimous indifference to meticulous niceties
Mainly, I believe
Maintained with ingenuity and vigor
Making allowances for differences of opinion
Making the ear greedy to remark offense
Manifestly harsh and barbarous
Many of us have had the good fortune
Many of you, perhaps, recollect
Many thanks--how kind and good you are!
March on my soul nor like the laggard stay
Marching down to posterity with divine honors
Marked out for some strange and preternatural doom
Marvelous copiousness of illustration
Marvelously suggestive and inspiring
Mawkishly effeminate sentiment
May I ask to whom you allude?
May I ask you to believe
May I ask you to do us a great favor by
May I be privileged to hear it?
May I not speak here
May I speak freely?
May I try to show that every effort
May I venture to ask what inference you would draw from that?
May I venture to suggest
May it not also be advanced
May the day come quickly
May we be favored with a reply
Me on whose heart as a worm she trod
Meaningless as the syllables of an unknown tongue
Meantime it is encouraging to think
Meantime soliciting your forbearance
Meanwhile let us freely recognize
Meanwhile permit me to thank you for your kind attention
Memories plucked from wood and field
Memory was busy at his heart
Men are in the habit of saying
Men are telling us nowadays
Men everywhere testify
Men moved hither and thither like insects in their crevices
Men of profound erudition           
Mentality as hard as bronze
Mentally round-shouldered and decrepit
Mere effects of negligence
Merge imperceptibly into one another like the hues of the prism
Merged in a sentiment of unutterable sadness and compassion
Meteors that dart like screaming birds
Microscopic analysis of character
Microscopic minuteness of eye
Might I suggest an alternative?
Milk-white pavements, clear and richly pale, like alabaster
Mingled distrust and fear
Ministering to mere pleasure and indulgence
Minutely and rationally exposing their imperfections
Misgivings of grave kinds
Mockery crept into her tone
Molded by the austere hand of adversity
Moments of utter idleness and insipidity
Moods of malicious reaction and vindictive recoil
Morbid and subjective brooding
More and more it is felt
More or less severe and prolonged
More than once have I had to express
More than this need not be said
More variegated than the skin of a serpent
Moreover, I have insisted
Moreover, I would counsel you
Moreover, when we pass judgment
Morn, in yellow and white, came broadening out of the mountains
Most dangerous!
Motion like the spirit of that wind whose soft step deepens slumber
Motionless as a plumb line
Mountains like frozen wrinkles on a sea
Moved to unaccustomed tears
Moving in the same dull round, like blind horses in a mill
Much has been said and written about
Mumble only jargon of dotage
Mute as an iceberg
My age is as a lusty Winter
My appreciation has been quickened
My attitude would be one of disapproval
My belief, therefore, is
My body broken as a turning wheel
My body is too frail for its moods
My breath to Heaven like vapor goes
My confidence in you is absolute
My duty is to endeavor to show
My experience tells me
My first duty is to express to you
My friends, I propose
My friends, do you really believe
My head was like a great bronze bell with one thought for the clapper
My heart is as some famine-murdered land
My heart is like a full sponge and must weep a little
My heart like a bird doth hover
My heart tells me
My heart will be as wind fainting in hot grass
My idea of it is quite the reverse
My idea, therefore, is
My information is rather scanty
My last criticism upon
My life floweth away like a river
My life was white as driven snow
My love for thee is like the sovereign moon that rules the sea
My love's like the steadfast sun
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer        
My meaning is quite the contrary
My mind is not moved by
My mind most perfectly acquiesces
My mind swayed idly like a water-lily in a lake
My muscles are as steel
My next objection is
My own private opinion is
My point of view is different, but I shall not insist upon it
My present business is
My regret is intensified by the thought
My skin is as sallow as gold
My soul was as a lampless sea
My spirit seemed to beat the void, like the bird from out the ark
My thoughts came yapping and growling round me like a pack of curs
My thoughts ran leaping through the green ways of my mind
My views are altered in many respects
My worst suspicions were confirmed
Mysterious and invincible darkness
Naked vigor of resolution
Naturally prone to believe
Nature seemed to revel in unwonted contrasts       
Nay, I boldly say
Nay, it will be a relief to my mind
Nay, there is a general feeling
Necessity thus imposed by prudence
Need I say that I mean
Neither should you deceive
Nerveless and faithless folly
Never before have I so strongly felt
Never can I cease to feel
Never did there devolve
Never for a moment believe
Never have I felt so forcibly
Never was a weaker defense attempted
Never was there a greater mistake
Never was there an instance
Nevertheless we can admit
New ambitions pressed upon his fancy
New dreams began to take wing in his imagination
Next, I consider
Next, from what has been said it is plain
Next, it will be denied
Night after night the skies were wine-blue and bubbling with stars
Night falls like fire
Night passes lightly in the open world,
Nights of fathomless blackness
No argument can overwhelm a fact
No defense is to be found
No distinct test can be named
No doubt there are many questions
No doubt to most of us
No doubt, in the first instance
No finer sentence has come down to us
No greater service could be rendered
No longer do we believe
No longer shall slander's venomed spite crawl
No man regrets more than I do
No mark of trick or artifice
No more than brief palliatives or mitigations
No one can feel this more strongly
No one can see the end
No one can, I think, pretend
No one here, I am sure
No one need to exaggerate
No one will accuse me
No one, I suppose, would say
No one, I think, can fail to observe
No one, I think, will dispute the statement
No true man ever believes
No, I am speaking seriously
No, I don't understand it
Noble and sublime patience
Noble and sublime patience
Noisy torrent of talk
None can have failed to observe
Nor am I disparaging or discouraging
Nor can I forget either
Nor can it justly be said
Nor can we afford to waste time
Nor can we forget how long
Nor can we now ask
Nor do I believe
Nor do I doubt
Nor do I pretend
Nor do I think there can be found
Nor does it matter much
Nor has there been wanting
Nor indeed am I supposing
Nor is it a fair objection
Nor is it probable
Nor is this all
Nor let me forget to add here
Nor must I be understood as saying
Nor must it be forgotten
Nor need we fear to speak
Nor should any attempt be made
Nor will I enlarge on the matter
Nor will history fail to record
Not at all
Not at all
Not averse to a little gossip
Not only so
Not so much polished as varnished
Not that I quarrel with
Not to my knowledge
Noted for their quixotic love of adventure
Nothing but the deepest sense
Nothing can be further from the truth
Nothing could be clearer
Nothing could be more captious or unfair
Nothing could be more delightful
Nothing could be more striking
Nothing is more common in the world
Nothing remained but a graceful acquiescence
Nothing that you can do
Notoriously distracted by internecine jealousies
Notwithstanding all that has been said
Notwithstanding all this, I hold
Now comes the question
Now every nerve in my body seemed like a strained harp-string
Now is it very plain to you?
Now like a wild nymph she veils her shadowy form
Now like a wild rose in the fields of heaven
Now memory and emotion surged in my soul like a tempest
Now thou seemest like a bankrupt beau, stripped of his gaudy hues
Now you are flippant
Now, I admit
Now, I am far from denying
Now, I am far from undervaluing
Now, I am justified in calling this
Now, I am obliged to say
Now, I do not wish you to believe
Now, I have a closing sentence or two
Now, I pass on to consider
Now, I shall not occupy your time
Now, I understand the argument
Now, I will undertake to say
Now, I wish to call your attention
Now, bear with me when I say
Now, comparing these instances together
Now, from these instances it is plain
Now, having spoken of
Now, if you will clearly understand
Now, is there any ground or basis for
Now, it is an undoubted fact
Now, it is evident
Now, it is not at all strange
Now, it is unquestioned
Now, let me speak with the greatest care
Now, let me stop a moment
Now, let us consider
Now, observe, my drift
Now, sir, I am truly horrified
Now, the answer we should give
Now, the question here at issue
Now, the world will say
Now, there is a close alliance between
Now, this is precisely the danger
Now, this is to some extent
Now, understand me definitely
Now, we do not maintain
Now, we will inquire
Now, what I want you to realize
Now, with regard to
Now, you will allow me to state
Now, you will understand from this
Nursed by brooding thought
Objects of general censure
Obscured beneath the rubbish of the age
Obscured with wrath as is the sun with cloud
Observe again
Obsessed with an overweening pride
Obsessed with the modishness of the hour
Obstacles that are difficult but not insuperable
Obviously at variance with facts
Obviously the matter is settled
Occasional flashes of tenderness and love
Occasionally you ought to read
Occasioned by direct moral turpitude   
Oddly amenable to the proposed innovations
Oddly disappointing and fickle
Odorous as all Arabia
Of course I am aware
Of course I am delighted
Of course I am putting an impossible case
Of course I can not be taken to mean
Of course I do not maintain
Of course I do not stop here
Of course I don't want to press you against your will
Of course I would not allow
Of course much may be said
Of course these remarks hold good
Of course we may, if we please
Of course you will do what you think best
Of course you will sympathize
Of course, but that again isn't the point
Of one thing, however, I am certain
Of this briefly
Of this statement I will only say
Of this truth I shall convince you by
Often employed promiscuously
Often enough life tosses like a fretful stream among rocky boulders
Oh, I appreciate that in you!
Oh, certainly, if you wish it
Oh, do not form an erroneous impression
Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud
Oh, that was a manner of speaking
Oh, that's mere quibbling
Oh, that's splendid of you!
Oh, yes, I quite admit that
Oh, yes, you may take that for granted
Oh, you are very bitter
Oh, you may be as scornful as you like
Old as the evening star
Old happy hours that have long folded their wings
Ominous and swift days
Omitting all compliments and commonplaces
On a noble and commanding scale
On a review of the whole subject
On occasions of this kind
On referring to your account we notice
On such a day as this
On sure ground of fact
On the contrary, I agree with you thoroughly
On the contrary, I am assuming
On the edge of great irritability
On the face of it, it sounds reasonable
On the horns of a dilemma
On the occasion to which I refer
On the other hand, it is clear
On the whole, then, I observe
On this auspicious occasion
On this point I do not mean to dwell
On this subject you need not suspect
Once again, like madness, the black shapes of doubt swing through his brain
Once again, there are those
Once more I emphasize
Once more let me try to put into words
One additional remark
One almost wishes
One assumption you make I should like to contest
One bleared star, faint glimmering like a bee
One bright drop is like the gem that decks a monarch's crown
One by one flitting like a mournful bird
One can not decline to note
One concluding remark has to be made
One deep roar as of a cloven world
One fact is clear and indisputable
One further word
One gracious fact emerges here
One has no choice to endure it
One important topic remains
One is fairly tempted to wish
One lesson history may be said to repeat
One long torture of soul
One might be challenged to produce
One must be indulgent under the circumstances
One of life's ironical adjustments
One of the ancients said
One of the foreseen and inevitable results
One of the golden twilights which transfigure the world
One of the most commonly known
One of the most extraordinary incidents
One of the things I recollect with most pride
One of these signs is the fact
One or two points are made clear
One other circumstance
One other remark suggests itself
One remark I will make
One thing I beg of you
One thing more will complete this question
One thing which always impressed me
One tissue of rashness, folly, ingratitude, and injustice
One very striking tendency
One winged cloud above like a spread dragon overhangs the west
One word in courtesy I must say
One word more in a serious vein
One would naturally suppose
Only so much do I know
Openly flouted and disavowed
Opinions are divided as to whether
Oppressed and disheartened by an all-pervading desolation
Oppressed by some vague dread
Oppressed by the indefiniteness which hung in her mind,
Oppressed with a confused sense of cumbrous material
Or shedding radiance like the smiles of God
Or to come nearer home
Or to take but one other example
Ordinarily speaking, such deductions
Organs of party rage and popular frenzy
Others may hold other opinions
Ought we not to think
Our enemies were broken like a dam of river reeds
Our hearts bowed down like violets after rain
Our letter must have gone astray
Our opinions were diametrically opposed
Our relations with your house must have hitherto been very pleasant
Our sail like a dew-lit blossom shone
Our services are at your command
Our stock has been temporarily exhausted
Our thoughts wander back
Our vaunted civilization
Outward mark of obeisance and humiliation
Outweighing years of sorrow and bitterness
Over and above all this
Over and over the paroxysms of grief and longing submerged her
Overcome by an access of misery
Overhead the intense blue of the noonday sky burst like a jewel in the sun
Overhung and overspread with ivy
Overshadowed by a fretful anxiety
Overshadowed by a vague depression
Overwhelmed with reproach and popular indignation
Owing to our inability to collect out-standing debts
Painful and lamentable indifference
Pale and grave as a sculptured nun
Pale and vague desolation
Pale as a drifting blossom
Pallor of reflected glories
Palpably and unmistakably commonplace
Palpitating with rage and wounded sensibility
Panting after distinction
Parading an exception to prove a rule
Paralyzed by infirmity of purpose
Paralyzing doubts and scruples
Paramount obligation and righteousness
Pardon me if
Pardon me, I meant something different
Pardon me, but I don't think so
Partial and fragmentary evidence
Passed like a phantom into the shadows
Passionately addicted to pleasure
Passive and tractable as a child
Patently inimical to liberty
Patience under continual provocation
Peace brooded over all
Peaceful as a village cricket-green on Sunday
Peculiarly liable to misinterpretation
Peddling and pitiful compromises
Peevish and impatient, like some ill-trained man who is sick
Pelted with an interminable torrent of words
Pelting one another with catchwords
Penetrate beneath the surface to the core
Peopled the night with thoughts
Perfectly illustrated and exemplified
Perhaps I am indiscreet
Perhaps I may be best able to illustrate
Perhaps I ought to say
Perhaps another reason why
Perhaps it may be doubted
Perhaps not in the strictest sense
Perhaps you do not feel at liberty to do so
Perhaps you think me ungrateful
Perhaps, however, in speaking to you
Perhaps, however, some among you will be
Perhaps, sir, I am mistaken in
Perished utterly, like a blown-out flame
Permit me frankly to say
Permit me to add
Permit me to add another circumstance
Permit me to bring home to you
Permit us to express our sincere appreciation
Perpetual gloom and seclusion of life
Perpetually excite our curiosity
Personally I confess to an objection
Personally, I am far too firm a believer
Pertinent to the thread of the discussion
Pervasive silence which wraps us in a mantle of content
Philosophy evolved itself, like a vast spider's loom
Pierced to the quick
Piles of golden clouds just peering above the horizon
Pillowed upon its alabaster arms
Pitiful shifts of policy
Plainly dictated by a lofty purpose
Platitudinous and pompously sentimental
Plaudits of the unlettered mob
Pleading the exigencies of strategical interest
Pleasant and flower-strewn vistas of airy fancy
Please accept the thanks of the writer
Please consider this letter an acknowledgment
Please continue to be frank
Please do not think I am asking out of mere curiosity
Please favor us with a personal communication
Please feel assured that we shall use every endeavor
Please forgive my thoughtlessness
Please make yourself at home
Pledged with enthusiastic fervor
Plumbing the depth of my own fears
Plunged into tumultuous preoccupation
Poignant doubts and misgivings
Pointed out with triumphant malice
Polished as the bosom of a star
Polished beauty of diction
Political storm and stress.
Position of titular command
Possibly the enclosure may suggest to you
Poured his heart out like the rending sea in passionate wave on wave
Pouting like the snowy buds o' roses in July
Power of intellectual metamorphosis
Power to assuage the thirst of the soul
Pray don't apologize
Pray forgive me for intruding on you so unceremoniously
Pray go on!
Pray, sir, let me say
Preached with a fierce unction        
Precipitate and arbitrary changes
Precipitated into mysterious depths of nothingness
Precisely, that is just what I meant
Predict the gloomiest consequences
Preening its wings for a skyward flight
Pregnant with a lesson of the deepest import
Preposition "by"
Preposition "in"
Preposition "into"
Preposition "to"
Preposition "with"
Presented with matchless vigor and courage
Presently she hovered like a fluttering leaf or flake of snow
Pressing cares absorbed him
Pride and self-disgust served her
Pride working busily within her
Princely generosity of praise
Proclaimed with joyous defiance
Prodigal of discriminating epithets
Prodigious and portentous events
Prodigious boldness and energy of intellect
Products of dreaming indolence
Profound and chilling solitude of the spot
Promptly on receipt of your telegram
Proof of his imperturbability and indifference
Protracted to a vexatious length
Proud as the proudest of church dignitaries
Proud schemes for aggrandizement
Provocative of bitter hostility
Provocative of bitter hostility
Pruned of their excrescences and grotesque extremes
Pulling the strings of many enterprises
Pure as a wild-flower
Pure as the azure above them
Pure as the naked heavens
Pure as the snowy leaves that fold over the flower's heart
Purge the soul of nonsense
Purged of glaringly offensive features
Purple, crimson, and scarlet, like the curtains of God's tabernacle
Pursuant to your letter
Pursued to a vicious extent
Put in that way it certainly sounds very well
Put on gravity like a robe
Quaking and quivering like a short-haired puppy after a ducking
Question me, if you wish
Questioned and tested in the crucible of experience
Questions and answers sounding like a continuous popping of corks
Quibbling, I call it
Quickened and enriched by new contacts with life and truth
Quickened into a stabbing suspicion
Quickness to conceive and courage to execute
Quiet as a nun's face
Quietly as a cloud he stole
Quietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water
Quite destitute of resources
Quite so
Quite the wisest thing you can do
Quivering like an eager race-horse to start
Quivering with restrained grief
Quixotically generous about money
Radiant with the beautiful glamor of youth
Radiantly and transparently happy
Rage, rage ye tears, that never more should creep
Railed at the world
Ran like a young fawn
Ransack the vocabulary
Rare candor and flexibility of mind
Rare fidelity of purpose and achievement
Rarely brought to pass
Rather loquacious, I think        
Rattle in the ear like a flourish of trumpets
Rays springing from the east like golden arrows
Read but your history aright
Reading between the lines
Really--you must go?
Really? I should have thought otherwise
Reassure me, if you can
Recently we had occasion
Recollect, sir
Red as the print of a kiss might be
Red tape of officialdom
Redolent of the night lamp
Redolent with the homely scent of old-fashioned herbs and flowers
Reeling headlong in luxury and sensuality
Referring to your esteemed favor
Reflect upon the possible consequences
Reflected each in the other like stars in a lake
Reflecting the solemn and unfathomable stars
Reflections such as these
Refreshed like dusty grass after a shower
Refreshing as descending rains to sunburnt climes
Regarded with an exulting pride
Regarded with sincere abhorrence
Regretting our inability to serve you in the present instance
Regulated by the fixed rules of good-breeding
Rehabilitated and restored to dignity
Relatively speaking
Religious rights and ceremonies
Reluctant as we are to believe
Reluctant to appear in so equivocal a character
Reluctantly I admit it
Rely upon it
Remember, I do not seek to
Remembering some past occurrences
Remorselessly swept into oblivion
Remote as the hidden star
Render null and void
Rent by internal contentions
Repugnant alike to reason and conscience
Requesting your kind attention to this matter
Resigned to growing infirmities
Resist a common adversary
Resounding generalities and conventional rhetoric
Respect forbade downright contradiction
Resting on some collateral circumstance
Restless and sore and haughty feelings were busy within
Restless as a blue-bottle fly on a warm summer's day
Retort leaped to his lips
Returning, then, to the consideration
Revealed his doings like those of bees in a glass hive
Reverting to another matter
Rhetorical and ambitious diction
Rich and exuberant complexities
Rich as the dawn
Ride like the wind through the night
Rigid adherence to conventionalities
Rigid and exact boundaries
Rivers that like silver threads
Roared like mountain torrents
Rolling it under the tongue as a sweet morsel
Rooted in immeasurable error and falsity
Round my chair the children run like little things of dancing gold
Roused to tumultuous activity
Ruddy as sunrise
Ruddy his face as the morning light
Rude and blind criticism
Rudely disconcerting in her behavior
Rudely reminded of life's serious issues
Ruffling out his cravat with a crackle of starch,
Running to and fro like frightened sheep
Rushing and hurrying about like a June-bug
Sacrificed to a futile sort of treadmill
Sadly counterbalanced by numerous faults
Sadness prevailed among her moods
Said with epigrammatic point          
Salutary in the extreme
Salutary tonic of a free current of public criticism
Sanctuaries where the passions may, like wild falcons,
Sanity and quietness of soul
Sayings that stir the blood like the sound of a trumpet
Scattered love as stars do light
Scorched with the lightning of momentary indignation
Scorned as an impracticable theory
Scornful of petty calculations
Scorning such paltry devices
Scotched but not slain
Screen themselves from punishment
Scrupulous and chivalrous loyalty
Scrupulous morality of conduct
Sea-gulls flying like flakes of the sea
See with eagle glance through conventionalisms
Seem to savor of paradox
Seem to swim in a sort of blurred mist before the eyes
Seething with suppressed wrath
Seize on greedily
Seize the auspicious moment
Self-centered anxiety and preoccupation
Self-command born of varied intercourse
Self-interest of the most compelling character
Selfish and uselessly recondite       
Selfishness pampered by abundance
Senses of marvelous acuteness
Sensible diminution of our comfort
Sensitive and apprehensive temperament
Sensuous enjoyment of the outward show of life
Sentences level and straight like a hurled lance
Sentimental wailings for the past
Serenity beamed from his look
Serenity of paralysis and death
Seriously, then, do I beg you
Seriousness lurked in the depths of her eyes
Serve the innocent purposes of life
Served to recruit his own jaded ideas
Set anew in some fresh and appealing form
Set down with meticulous care
Setting all the sane traditions at defiance
Shadowy faces, known in dreams, pass as petals upon a stream
Shadowy vistas of sylvan beauty
Shake like an aspen leaf
Shaken off like a nightmare
Shall I tell you
Shall we complain
Shall we have a compact?
Shames us out of our nonsense
Shapeless as a sack of wool
Sharp outbursts of hatred and bitterness
Sharp restrictions of duty and opportunity
Sharply and definitely conceived
Shattered like so much glass
She affected disdain
She assented in precisely the right terms
She bandies adjectives with the best
She brightened like a child whose broken toy is glued together
She challenged his dissent
She cherished no petty resentments
She could summon tears as one summons servants
She curled her fastidious lip
She curled her lip with defiant scorn
She danced like a flower in the wind
She did her best to mask her agitation
She disarmed anger and softened asperity        
She disclaimed fatigue
She disclaimed the weariness that
She exuded a faint and intoxicating perfume of womanliness,
She fell into a dreamy silence
She fell into abstracted reverie
She felt herself carried off her feet by the rush of incoherent impressions
She felt like an unrepentant criminal
She fled like a spirit from the room
She flounders like a huge conger-eel in an ocean of dingy morality
She flushed an agitated pink
She forced a faint quivering smile
She frowned incomprehension
She gave him a surprised look,
She gave off antipathies as a liquid gives off vapor
She had an air of restrained fury
She had an undercurrent of acidity
She had lost her way in a labyrinth of conjecture
She has an extraordinary gift of conversation
She has great eyes like the doe
She heard him like one in a dream
She hugged the thought of her own unknown and unapplauded integrity
She is easily prejudiced
She let the soft waves of her deep hair fall like flowers from Paradise
She lingered a few leisurely seconds
She looked like a tall golden candle
She looked like the picture of a young rapt saint, lost in heavenly musing
She moved like mirth incarnate
She nestles like a dove
She nodded mutely
She nourished a dream of ambition
She permitted herself a delicate little smile
She played with a hundred possibilities
She played with grave cabinets as a cat plays with a mouse
She poured out on him the full opulence of a proud recognition
She questioned inimically             
She recaptured herself with difficulty
She regarded him stonily out of flint-blue eyes
She sat eyeing him with frosty calm
She saw this planet like a star hung in the glistening depths of even
She seemed as happy as a wave that dances on the sea
She seemed the embodiment of dauntless resolution
She seemed wrapped in a veil of lassitude
She seems uncommonly appreciative
She shall be sportive as the fawn
She shook hands grudgingly
She softened her frown to a quivering smile
She spoke with hurried eagerness
She spoke with sweet severity
She stilled and trampled on the inward protest
She stood her ground with the most perfect dignity
She stood silent a moment, dropping before him like a broken branch
She strangled a fierce tide of feeling that welled up within her
She swept away all opposing opinion with the swift rush of her enthusiasm
She that passed had lips like pinks
She thrived on insincerity
She took refuge in a passionate exaggeration of her own insufficiency
She twitted him merrily
She walked like a galley-slave
She walks in beauty like the night
She was as brilliant, and as hard too, as electric light
She was both weary and placated
She was conscious of a tumultuous rush of sensations
She was demure and dimly appealing
She was exquisitely simple
She was gripped with a sense of suffocation and panic
She was in an anguish of sharp and penetrating remorse
She was oppressed by a dead melancholy
She was silent, standing before him like a little statuesque figure
She was stricken to the soul
She will be immensely surprised
She wore an air of wistful questioning
Sheer midsummer madness
Sheer superfluity of happiness
Shining like the dewy star of dawn
Shivering pine-trees, like phantoms
Should there be objection, I answer
Should you decide to act upon this latter suggestion
Show me that the two cases are analogous
Showy as damask-rose and shy as musk
Shrill as the loon's call
Shrivel like paper thrust into a flame
Shy as the squirrel
Sickening contrasts and diabolic ironies of life
Sights seen as a traveling swallow might see them on the wing
Silence deep as death
Silence fell
Silence now is brooding
Silence that seemed heavy and dark; like a passing cloud
Silly displays of cheap animosity
Simple and obvious to a plain understanding
Since, then, it is provided
Since, then, this is the case
Singing lustily as if to exorcise the demon of gloom
Sinister and fatal augury       
Sinks clamorous like mill-waters at wild play
Sir, with all my heart, I respond
Sits like the maniac on his fancied throne
Skies as clear as babies' eyes
Skirmishes and retreats of conscience
Skulking beneath a high-sounding benevolence
Slack-minded skimming of newspapers
Slavish doctrines of sectarianism
Sleek and thick and yellow as gold
Slender and thin as a slender wire
Slender experience of the facts of life
Slope towards extinction
Slow and resistless forces of conviction
Slow the movement was and tortuous
Slowly as a tortoise
Slowly as the finger of a clock, her shadow came
Slowly disengaging its significance from the thicket of words
Slowly moved off and disappeared
Slowly, unnoted, like the creeping rust
Small as a grain of mustard seed
Smooth as a pond
Smooth as the pillar flashing in the sun
Smug respectability and self-content
Snatch some advantage
Snug as a bug in a rug
So I inferred
So I say to you
So accustomed are we
So at least it seems to me
So elusive that the memory of it afterwards
So far as I know
So far as my observation and experience goes
So far in general
So far so good
So innocent in her exuberant happiness
So it comes to pass
So long as we continue to love truth and duty
So many requests of a similar nature come to us
So men are asking
So much at first sight
So much on this subject
So much the better for me
So my spirit beat itself like a caged bird against its prison bars in vain
So that I may venture to say
So that if you were persuaded
So then ought we also
So when I hear people say
So you observe the transformation?
So, to add one other example
So, too, I may go on to speak
Soar into a rosy zone of contemplation
Soaring as swift as smoke from a volcano springs
Socialized and exacting studies
Soft as Spring
Soft as a zephyr
Soft as sleep the snow fell
Soft as the down of the turtle dove
Soft as the landscape of a dream
Soft as the south-wind
Soft in their color as gray pearls
Soft vibrations of verbal melody, like the sound of a golden bell
Softened by the solicitude of untiring and anxious love
Soliciting a continuance of your patronage
Solitary and sorely smitten souls
Some dim-remembered and dream-like images
Some exquisite refinement in the architecture of the brain
Some flash of witty irrelevance
Some gleams of feeling pure and warm as sunshine on a sky of storm
Some have insisted
Some like veiled ghosts hurrying past
Some minds are like an open fire--how direct and instant
Some of you can recall the time
Some of you may think this visionary
Some of you will remember
Some one will perhaps object
Some prejudice is attached
Some very undignified disclosures
Some writer has said
Something amuses you
Something curiously suggestive and engaging
Something divine seemed to cling around her like some subtle vapor
Something eminently human beaconed from his eyes
Something essentially inexpressible
Something full of urgent haste
Something indescribably reckless and desperate in such a picture
Something resistant and inert, like the obstinate rolling over
Something sharp and brilliant, like the glitter of a sword
Something stifling and over-perfumed
Something that seizes tyrannously upon the soul
Sometimes I venture to think
Sometimes it may happen
Sometimes the absurdity of it occurs to me
Sore beset by the pressure of temptation
Sorrowful eyes like those of wearied kine spent from the plowing
Speaking in this place
Speaking with all due respect
Specious show of impeccability
Spectacular display of wrath
Spinning a network of falsehoods
Spiritual and moral significance
Spread like wildfire
Spur and whip the tired mind into action
Squirrel-in-the-cage kind of movement
Stale and facile platitudes
Stamped with unutterable and solemn woe
Stamping like a plowman to shuffle off the snow
Stared about like calves in a pen
Staring in helpless bewilderment
Startled into perilous activity
Startling as this may appear to you
Startling leaps over vast gulfs of time
Stating only the truth, I affirm
Steadfast as the soul of truth
Steals lingering like a river smooth
Stealthily escaping observation
Stem the tide of opinion
Stern determination to inflict summary justice
Stern emptying of the soul
Stigmatized as moral cowards
Still I can not part from my subject
Still I have generally found
Still I imagine you would consider it
Still I know what answer I can make to
Still another encouraging fact
Still as death
Still further
Still it may with justice be said
Still one thing more
Still we ought to be grateful
Still, you might make an exception
Stimulated to an ever deepening subtlety
Stimulated to profitable industry
Stirred into a true access of enthusiasm
Stony insensibility to the small pricks and frictions of daily life
Stood like a wave-beaten rock
Stopped as if on the verge of profundities
Straight as a ray of light
Straight as an arrow
Strange as it may seem
Strange capacities and suggestions both of vehemence and pride
Strange frankness of cynical brutality
Strange laughings and glitterings of silver streamlets
Strange streak of melancholy
Strangely it's true
Strangled by a snare of words
Streamed like a meteor through the troubled air
Streamed o'er his memory like a forest flame
Streaming tears, like pearl drops from a flint
Strenuous and conscientious endeavor
Stretched out in dreary monotony
Strict and unalloyed veracity
Strictly in confidence, I do not think
Strictly speaking, there is no such thing
Striking with the force of an engine of destruction
Stripped to its bare skeleton
Strode forth imperiously   
Strong as a bison
Struck by a sudden curiosity
Struck dumb with strange surprise
Struck incessantly and remorselessly
Stung by his thoughts, and impatient of rest
Stung by the splendor of the prospect
Stupendous and awe-inspiring spectacle
Style comes, if at all, like the bloom upon fruit,
Subdued passages of unobtrusive majesty
Subject to the vicissitudes of fortune
Subjected to the grossest cruelties
Sublime indifference to contemporary usage and taste
Submission to an implied rebuke
Subordination to the common weal
Subservient to the ends of religion
Subtle as jealousy
Subtle indications of great mental agitation
Subtle suggestions of remoteness
Such a doctrine is essentially superficial
Such are the rather tolerant ideas
Such conduct seems to me unjustifiable
Such considerations as these
Such illustrations are not frequent
Such is steadfastly my opinion
Such is the deep prejudice now existing
Such is the intellectual view we take
Such is the lesson which I am taught
Such is the progress
Such is the truth
Such things as the eye of history sees
Such was the petty chronicle
Such, I believe, would be the consequences
Such, in brief, is the story
Such, sir, I conceive to be
Such, then, is the true idea
Such, too, is the characteristic of
Sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose, flushing his brow
Sudden and inexplicable changes of mood
Sudden sprays of rain, like volleys of sharp arrows,
Suddenly a thought shook him
Suddenly and imperatively summoned
Suddenly overawed by a strange, delicious shyness
Suddenly smitten with unreality
Suddenly snuffed out in the middle of ambitious schemes
Suddenly swelled to unprecedented magnitude
Suddenly, like death, the truth flashed on them
Suffer me to point out
Suffered to languish in obscurity
Suffice it to say here
Sufficient to repel vulgar curiosity
Sugared remonstrances and cajoleries
Suggestions of veiled and vibrant feeling
Suggestive sagacity and penetration      
Suit the means to the end
Sullen and widespread discontent
Summer clouds floating feathery overhead
Summing up what I have said
Sunbeams flashing on the face of things
Sunday mornings which seem to put on, like a Sabbath garment,
Sunk in a phraseological quagmire
Sunk into a gloomy reverie
Sunny silence broods over the realm of little cottages
Superior in strength and prowess
Supple and sweet as a rose in bloom
Supported by a splendid fearlessness
Suppose we turn our eyes to
Supreme arbiter of conduct
Supremely and undeniably great
Surely I do not misinterpret
Surely it is a paradox
Surely it is not too much for me to say
Surely there can be no question about that
Surely we can speak frankly
Surely you sound too harsh a note
Surely you would not countenance that
Susceptibility to fleeting impressions
Susceptible to every impulse and stimulus
Sustained dignity and mellifluous precision
Swamping every aspiration and ambition
Sway like blown moths against the rosewhite flame
Sweet as a summer night without a breath
Sweet as music she spoke
Sweet as the rain at noon
Sweet as the smile of a fairy
Sweet smoke of burning twigs hovered in the autumn day
Swift and vehement outbursts of feeling
Swift as a swallow heading south
Swift as lightning
Swift as the panther in triumph
Swift summer into the autumn flowed
Swifter than the twinkling of an eye
Take another instance
Take one of the most recent cases
Take root in the heart
Take the simple fact
Take this example
Take vengeance upon arrogant self-assertion
Taken in their totality
Taking a broader view
Taking the facts by themselves
Taking the larger sweeps in the march of mind
Talking and thinking became to him like the open page of a monthly magazine
Tall lance-like reeds wave sadly o'er his head
Tamed and wonted to a settled existence
Tears of outraged vanity blurred her vision
Teased with impertinent questions
Tell me in what way you want me to help you
Tempered by the emotional warmth of high moral ideals
Tenderness breathed from her
Tense with the anguish of spiritual struggle
Terror filled the more remote chambers of his brain with riot
Tethered to earth
Thank you for telling me that
Thank you for your expression of confidence
Thank you for your good intentions
Thanking you for your inquiry
Thanking you for your past patronage
Thanking you for your promptness.
Thanking you in advance for an early reply
Thanking you in anticipation
That depends on one's point of view
That doesn't sound very logical
That is a counsel of perfection
That is a fair question, perhaps
That is a further point
That is a humiliating thought
That is a most interesting idea
That is a natural boast
That is a pure assumption
That is a question I have often proposed to myself
That is a stroke of good fortune
That is a superb piece of work
That is a very practical explanation
That is admirably clear
That is all that it seems necessary to me
That is all very good
That is certainly ideal
That is eminently proper
That is far from my thoughts
That is final and conclusive
That is hardly consistent
That is inconceivable
That is just like you, if you will forgive me for saying so
That is most fortunate
That is most kind of you
That is most unexpected and distressing
That is not fair--to me
That is not to be lightly spoken of
That is precisely what I mean
That is quite true, theoretically
That is rather a difficult question to answer
That is rather a strange request to make
That is rather awkward
That is really good of you
That is such a hideous idea
That is the lesson of history
That is the most incredible part of it
That is the prevailing idea
That is the question of questions
That is tragic
That is true and I think you are right
That is very amiable in you
That is very curious
That is very felicitous
That is very gracious
That is what I call intelligent criticism
That is what I meant to tell you
That like a wounded snake drags its slow length along
That might involve you in life-long self-reproach
That must be exceedingly tiresome
That ought to make you a little lenient
That reassures me
That shows the infirmity of his judgment
That theory isn't tenable
That was exceedingly generous
That was intended ironically
That was very thoughtful of you
That was very well reasoned
That way madness lies
That which flutters the brain for a moment
That will blast your chances, I am afraid
That will suit me excellently
That would be somewhat serious
That would be very discreditable
That you may conceive the force of
That, at least, you will agree to
The Milky Way lay like diamond-dust upon the robe of some great king
The Spring breaks like a bird
The abysmal depths of despair
The accelerated beat of his thoughts
The accumulated bitterness of failure
The affluent splendor of the summer day
The afternoon was filled with sound and sunshine
The afternoon was waning
The agonies of conscious failure
The agreement seems to be ideal
The air and sky belonged to midsummer
The air darkened swiftly
The air is touched with a lazy fragrance, as of hidden flowers
The air was caressed with song
The air was full of fugitive strains of old songs
The air was full of the cry and clamor
The air was raw and pointed
The allurements of a coquette
The ambition and rivalship of men
The anemone that weeps at day-break, like a silly girl before her lover
The angry blood burned in his face
The anguish of a spiritual conflict tore his heart
The animadversions of critics        
The answer is easy to find
The answer is ready
The applause was unbounded
The army blazed and glowed in the golden sunlight
The army like a witch's caldron seethed
The artificial smile of languor
The awful and implacable approach of doom
The babble of brooks grown audible
The babbledom that dogs the heels of fame
The bait proved incredibly successful
The balm of solitary musing
The beating of her heart was like a drum
The beauty of her quiet life was like a rose in blowing
The beauty straightway vanished
The beckonings of alien appeals
The belief is born of the wish
The benign look of a father
The best proof of its timeliness and salutariness
The bewildered and tumultuous world
The billows burst like cannon down the coast
The birds swam the flood of air like tiny ships
The blackest abyss of despair
The blandishments of pleasure and pomp of power
The blemishes of an extraordinary reputation
The blinding mist came down and hid the land
The blue bowl of the sky, all glorious with the blaze of a million worlds
The bluntness of a provincial
The boat cuts its swift way through little waves like molten gold and opal
The bogey of bad luck    
The boom of the surf grew ever less sonorous,
The bound of the pulse of spring
The bounding pulse of youth
The breast-plate of righteousness
The breathless hours like phantoms stole away
The breeze is as a pleasant tune
The broad principle which I would lay down
The brunt of life
The buzz of idolizing admiration
The calm white brow as calm as earliest morn
The camp fire reddens like angry skies
The capacity for refined pursuits
The caressing peace of bright soft sunshine
The causes for the delay were beyond our control
The chambers of the house were haunted by an incessant echoing,
The chaotic sound of the sea
The charming omniscience of youth
The chill of forlorn old age
The chill of night crept in from the street
The chivalric sentiment of honor
The chivalrous homage of respect
The church swarmed like a hive
The circumstances under which we meet
The city is all in a turmoil; it boils like a pot of lentils
The clamorous agitation of rebellious passions
The climax of my purpose in this address
The cloak of cowardice
The clouded, restless, jaded mood
The clouds that move like spirits o'er the welkin clear   
The clustered apples burnt like flame
The collective life of humanity
The colored bulbs swung noon-like from tree and shrub
The combined dictates of reason and experience
The common consent of civilized mankind
The companion of a noble and elevated spirit
The complaining gate swung open
The complex phenomena of life
The conclusion is irresistible
The confusing assertion is sometimes made
The consequence of an agitated mind
The consequence of ignorance and childish assumption
The constant iteration of the sea's wail
The constant pressure of anxieties
The contagion of extravagant luxury
The conversation became desultory      
The creature and tool of a party
The crimson close of day
The critical eyes of posterity
The crowning touch of pathos
The curl'd moon was like a little feather
The curling wreaths like turbans seem
The current of his ideas flowed full and strong
The dance whizzed on with cumulative fury
The dark hours are swept away like crumbling ashes
The dark mass of her hair shook round her like a sea
The dawn had whitened in the mist like a dead face
The dawn is rising from the sea, like a white lady from her bed
The dawn is singing at the door
The dawn with silver-sandaled feet crept like a frightened girl.
The day have trampled me like armed men
The day is at hand
The day sang itself into evening
The day stunned me like light upon some wizard way
The day was at once redolent and vociferous
The day was blind with fog
The day was gracious
The day was sweeter than honey and the honey-comb
The days passed in a stately procession
The days when you dared to dream
The dead and dusty past
The dead past flew away over the fens like a flight of wild swans
The debilitating fears of alluring fate
The decided objection is raised
The deep and solemn purple of the summer night
The deep flush ebbed out of his face
The deep like one black maelstrom round her whirls
The deep tranquillity of the shaded solitude
The deepening east like a scarlet poppy burnt
The deepening twilight filled with shadowy visions
The deepest wants and aspirations of his soul
The delicatest reproof of imagined distrust
The delimitation is sufficiently definite
The demerit of an unworthy alliance
The desire of the moth for the star
The desolate rocky hills rolled like a solid wave along the horizon
The dictates of plain reason
The dimness of the sealed eye and soul
The disjointed babble of the chronicler
The doctrine I am combating
The doctrine is admirable
The dome of heaven is like one drop of dew
The dreams of poets come like music heard at evening
The dreamy solicitations of indescribable afterthoughts
The dull derision of the world
The dullest and most vacant minds
The dumb forces of brute nature
The dupe of some imposture
The dying day lies beautiful in the tender glow of the evening
The eager pretentiousness of youth
The eagerness faded from his eyes,
The early morning of the Indian summer day was tinged with blue mistiness
The earth looked despoiled
The earth was like a frying-pan, or some such hissing matter
The east alone frowned with clouds
The easy grace of an unpremeditated agreeable talker
The easy-going indolence of a sedentary life
The ebb and flow of events
The echo of its wrathful roar surged and boomed among the hills
The effect too often is
The empurpled hills standing up, solemn and sharp,
The enchanting days of youth
The eternal questioning of inscrutable fate
The eternal sea, which like a childless mother,
The evening comes with slow steps
The evening sky was as green as jade
The evening star silvery and solitary on the girdle of the early night
The everlasting deluge of books
The evil was irremediable
The evolution of events has brought
The exaggerations of morbid hallucinations
The exchange of harmless amenities
The excitement had spread through the whole house,
The excitement of rival issues
The excitement of the thought
The exertion of an inherent power
The expression was keenly intellectual
The extraordinary wistful look of innocence and simplicity
The eye of a scrutinizing observer
The eyes burnt with an amazing fire
The eyes filled with playfulness and vivacity
The facile conjectures of ignorant onlookers
The fact has made a deep impression on me
The fact has often been insisted
The fact to be particularly noted
The facts are clear and unequivocal
The facts may be strung together
The facts took him by the throat
The father's vigil of questioning sorrow
The feathery meadows like a lilac sea
The fine flower of culture
The firm body like a slope of snow
The first business of every man
The first counsel I would offer
The first great fact to remember is
The first point to be ascertained
The first practical thought is
The first recoil from her disillusionment
The first remarkable instance was
The first thing I wish to note
The first thing that we have to consider
The first whiff of reality dissipated them like smoke
The fitful swerving of passion
The flabbiness of our culture
The flaccid moods of prose
The flame of discord raged with redoubled fury
The flattest and most obvious truisms
The flawless triumph of art
The flight of the autumnal days
The flippant insolence of a decadent skepticism
The floor, newly waxed, gleamed in the candle-light like beaten moonbeams
The flower of courtesy
The fluttering of untried wings
The foe of excess and immoderation
The fog of prejudice and ill-feeling
The foreground was incredibly shabby
The fragrance of a dear and honored name
The fragrant clouds of hair, they flowed round him like a snare
The freshening breeze struck his brow with a cooling hand
The freshness of some pulse of air from an invisible sea
The fruit of vast and heroic labors
The frustration of their dearest hopes
The future historian will, no doubt
The garb of civilization
The gathering glory of life shone like the dawn
The general effect was of extraordinary lavish profusion
The general infusion of wit
The generous feeling that has promoted you
The gesture was all strength and will,
The gift of prophecy
The girl's voice rang like a bird-call through his rustling fancies
The give and take was delicious
The glimmer of tall flowers standing
The gloom of the afternoon deepened
The gloom of winter dwelt on everything
The gloomy insolence of self-conceit
The glow of the ambitious fire
The golden gloom of the past and the bright-hued hope of the future
The golden riot of the autumn leaves
The golden sunlight of a great summer day
The golden years of youth and maturity
The gratification of ambition
The gray air rang and rippled with lark music
The great mass of the people
The grim reality of defeat
The grimaces and caperings of buffoonery
The grotesque nightmare of a haunting fear
The guides sniffed, like chamois, the air
The hall-mark of a healthy humanity
The hand of time sweeps them into oblivion
The handmaid of tyranny
The haunting melody of some familiar line of verse
The haunting phrase leaped to my brain
The headlong vigor of sheer improvisation
The heavens are like a scroll unfurled
The heights of magnanimity and love
The high-bred pride of an oriental
The hill-tops gleam in morning's spring
The hills across the valley were purple as thunder-clouds
The hills were clad in rose and amethyst
The hint of tranquillity and self-poise
The hinted sweetness of the challenge aroused him
The hints of an imaginable alliance
The hobgoblin of little minds
The holiest and most ennobling sensations of the soul
The hollowest of hollow shams
The homely virtue of practical utility
The hoofs of the horses rang like the dumb cadence of an old saga
The hot humiliation of it overwhelmed her
The hour is at hand
The hours crawled by like years
The hubbub and turmoil of the great world
The huge and thoughtful night
The hum of the camp sounds like the sea
The hungry curiosity of the mind
The hurly-burly of events
The hurrying crowds of men gather like clouds
The idea is monstrous
The idea was utterly hateful and repugnant
The ideas succeeded each other like a dynasty of kings
The idiosyncratic peculiarities of thought
The idle chatter of the crowd
The idle of all hobbledehoys       
The ignoble exploitation of public interests
The illustration is analogous
The immediate tyranny of a present emotion
The imminent fatality awaiting him
The impalpable presence of the new century
The important thing is
The impulse of prejudice or caprice
The inaccessible solitude of the sky
The incarnation of all loveliness
The incoherent loquacity of a nervous patient 
The incorrigibility of perverse human nature
The incursions of a venomous rabble
The indefinable air of good-breeding
The indefinable yearning for days that were dead
The indefinite atmosphere of an opulent nature
The indulgence of an overweening self-conceit
The inevitable climax and culmination
The inexorable facts closed in on him
The inference is inescapable
The inference is obvious
The infirmity and fallibility of human nature
The inflexible serenity of the wheeling sun
The ingenuities of legal verbiage
The inmost recesses of the human heart
The insipidity of indifference
The insolence of power
The instance I shall choose
The intercepted glances of wondering eyes
The intrusive question faded
The invidious stigma of selfishness        
The iron hand of oppression
The irony of circumstances
The irresistible and ceaseless onflow of time
The irresistible tendency of
The irrevocable past and the uncertain future
The jaded weariness of overstrained living
The jargon of well-handled and voice-worn phrases
The jostling and ugliness of life
The kindness with which I have been received
The lake glimmered as still as a mirror
The land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell
The land was like a dream
The landscape ran, laughing, downhill to the sea
The last and distinguishing feature is
The latest inclination I have seen
The lawyer's habit of circumspection and delay
The leaden sky rests heavily on the earth
The leaves of time drop stealthily
The leaves syllabled her name in cautious whispers
The lesson which we should take most to heart
The level boughs, like bars of iron across the setting sun
The light of London flaring like a dreary dawn
The lights blazed up like day
The lights winked
The lilies were drooping, white, and wan,
The little incident seemed to throb with significance
The lofty grace of a prince
The long-delayed hour of retribution
The loud and urgent pageantry of the day
The low hills on the horizon wore a haze of living blue
The lowest grade of precarious mendacity     
The machinations of a relentless mountebank
The machinations of an unscrupulous enemy
The magical lights of the horizon
The main cause of all this
The majestic solemnity of the moment
The makeshifts of mediocrity
The malarious air of after-dinner gossip
The margin of profit which we allow ourselves
The marvelous beauty of her womanhood
The maximum of attainable and communicable truth
The mazes of conflicting testimony
The mean and frivolous affections of the idle
The melancholy day weeps in monotonous despair
The mellowing hand of time
The melodies of birds and bees
The melody rose tenderly and lingeringly
The memory of the night grew fantastic and remote
The menacing shadow of want
The mere fruit of his distempered imagination
The mere reversal of the wheel of fortune
The merest smattering of knowledge
The meticulous observation of facts
The meticulous preciosity of the lawyer and the logician
The mind freezes at the thought
The mind was filled with a formless dread
The mocking echoes of long-departed youth
The moment marked an epoch
The monk's face whitened like sea-foam
The moon drowsed between the trees like a great yellow moth
The moon is waning below the horizon
The moon on the tower slept soft as snow
The moonbeams rest like a pale spotless shroud
The moonlight lay like snow
The moonlight, like a fairy mist, upon the mesa spreads
The more you examine this matter
The more's the pity
The morning beckons
The morning droned along peacefully
The mortal coldness of the soul, like death itself comes down
The most absurd elementary questions
The most amazing impudence
The most concise tribute paid
The most exacting and exciting business
The most fallacious of all fallacies
The most implacable logic
The most preposterous pride
The most reasonable anticipation
The most remarkable step forward
The most servile acquiescence
The most striking characteristic
The most sublime instance that I know
The mountain shadows mingling, lay like pools above the earth
The mountains loomed up dimly, like phantoms through the mist
The multiplicity of odors competing for your attention
The multitudinous tongue of the people
The murmur of soft winds in the tree-tops
The murmur of the surf boomed in melancholy mockery
The murmuring of summer seas
The music almost died away, then it burst like a pent-up flood
The music and mystery of the sea
The music of her delicious voice
The music of her presence was singing a swift melody in his blood
The music of unforgotten years sounded again in his soul
The mute melancholy landscape
The mystery obsessed him
The naked fact of death
The name that cuts into my soul like a knife
The nameless and inexpressible fascination of midnight music
The narrow glen was full of the brooding power of one universal spirit
The nascent spirit of chivalry
The nervous little train winding its way like a jointed reptile
The new ferns were spread upon the earth like some lacy coverlet
The next point is
The next question to be considered is
The next thing I consider indispensable
The night like a battle-broken host is driven before
The night was drowned in stars
The night yawned like a foul wind
The notion is rather new to me
The occasion that calls us together
The ocean swelled like an undulating mirror of the bowl of heaven
The old books look somewhat pathetically from the shelves,
The old infamy will pop into daylight
The old ruddy conviction deserted me
The one central difference between
The only course that remains open
The only plea to be offered
The onrush and vividness of life
The opulent sunset
The orange pomp of the setting sun
The oscillations of human genius
The other day I observed
The outcome of unerring observation
The outpourings of a tenderness reawakened by remorse
The outraged conscience of mankind
The overpowering force of circumstances and necessity
The overweening exercise of power
The pageantry of sea and sky
The palest abstractions of thought
The palpitating silence lengthened
The panacea for the evils of society
The panorama of history
The panorama of life was unrolled before him
The paramount consideration is
The paraphernalia of power and prosperity
The parting crimson glory of the ripening summer sun
The past slowly drifted out of his thought
The penalty falls like a thunderbolt from heaven
The pendulous eyelids of old age
The penetrating odors assailed his memory as something unforgettable
The pent-up intolerance of years of repression
The perfume of the mounting sea saturated the night with wild fragrance
The perils that beset us here
The pernicious doctrines of skeptics
The perpetrator of clumsy witticisms
The phrase was like a spear-thrust
The pine trees waved as waves a woman's hair
The piquancy of the pageant of life     
The pith and sinew of mature manhood
The place was like some enchanted town of palaces
The plains to northward change their color
The pleasing duty is assigned me
The pleasure is certainly not all on your side
The plenitude of her piquant ways     
The point I have urged upon you is
The point I wish a little further to speak of
The point to which I shall call your attention
The poppy burned like a crimson ember
The popular notion is
The practical inference from all this
The precarious tenure of fame
The precursor of violence
The presage of disaster was in the air
The presence of this brilliant assemblage
The pressing question is
The pressure of accumulated misgivings
The preternatural pomposities of the pulpit
The pretty and delicate game of talk
The prevalent opinion, no doubt
The prime of man has waxed like cedars
The primitive instinct of self-preservation
The pristine freshness of spring
The proof is in this fact
The proof of this statement is to be found
The property of little minds
The prophecies of visionaries and enthusiasts
The proposition appeals to us as a good one
The proprieties of etiquette
The public press would chatter and make odd ambiguous sounds
The pull of soul on body
The pulse of the rebounding sea
The purging sunlight of clear poetry
The purple heather rolls like dumb thunder
The purple vaulted night
The purse-proud inflation of the moneyed man
The question drummed in head and heart day and night
The question irresistibly emerged
The question is deeply involved
The question was disconcertingly frank
The question, then, recurs
The quick pulse of gain
The radiant serenity of the sky
The radiant stars brooded over the stainless fields,
The rainbows flashed like fire
The ravening wolves of brute instinct
The reason is not so far to seek
The remark was sternly uncompromising
The remedy I believe to be
The restlessness of offended vanity
The result of caprice
The result of the whole
The result, I fancy, has been
The retreating splendor of autumn
The rigor of the law
The rising storm of words
The river ran darkly, mysteriously by
The river sang with its lips to the pebbles
The river shouted as ever its cry of joy over the vitality of life,
The roar of the traffic rose to thunder
The romantic ardor of a generous mind
The roofs with their gables like hoods
The room had caught a solemn and awful quietude
The roses lie upon the grass like little shreds of crimson silk
The rosy twilight of boyhood
The rosy-hued sky went widening off into the distance
The royal arrogance of youth
The rule will always hold good
The sacred voice of inspiration
The sadness in him deepened inexplicably
The same is true in respect of
The same problem has perplexed me
The sanction and authority of a great name
The satire of the word cut like a knife
The scars of rancor and remorse
The scene all comes back
The scent of roses stole in with every breath of air
The scullion with face shining like his pans
The sea heaved silvery, far into the night
The sea reeled round like a wine-vat splashing
The sea slept under a haze of golden winter sun
The sea spread out like a wrinkled marble floor
The sea was as untroubled as the turquoise vault which it reflected
The sea, that gleamed still, like a myriad-petaled rose
The sea-song of the trampling waves is as muffled bells
The sea-sweep enfolds you, satisfying eye and mind
The sea-wind buffeted their faces
The secret and subduing charm of the woods
The see-saw of a wavering courage
The sentiment is worthy of you
The sentiment to which I am to respond
The sentiment which you have expressed
The sentimental tourist will be tempted to tarry
The setting of the sun is like a word of peace
The severest shocks of adverse fate
The shadows of the night seemed to retreat
The shadows rested quietly under the breezeless sky
The shafts of ridicule
The sharp and vehement assertion of authority
The sharp hail rattles against the panes and melts on my cheeks like tears
The sheer weight of unbearable loneliness
The ships, like sheeted phantoms coming and going
The shiver of the dusk passed fragrantly down the valley
The silence grew stolid
The silence seemed to crush to earth
The silence was uncomfortable and ominous
The silent day perfumed with the hidden flowers
The silver silence of the night
The silvery morning like a tranquil vision fills the world
The simple rule and test
The simple truth is
The simplest thing in the world
The sinister influence of unprincipled men
The sinking sun made mellow gold of all the air
The situation is uncommonly delicate
The sky burned like a heated opal
The sky gleamed with the hardness and brilliancy of blue enamel
The sky grew brighter with the imminent day
The sky grew ensaffroned with the indescribable hue that heralds day
The sky put on the panoply of evening
The sky was a relentless, changeless blue
The sky was as a shield
The sky was clear and blue, and the air as soft as milk
The sky was dull and brooding
The sky was heavily sprinkled with stars
The sky was like a peach
The sky was turning to the pearly gray of dawn
The sky where stars like lilies white and fair shine through the mists
The smiling incarnation of loveliness
The solid air around me there heaved like a roaring ocean
The solid mountains gleamed like the unsteady sea
The song of hurrying rivers
The soul is like a well of water springing up into everlasting life
The sound is like a noon-day gale
The sound is like a silver-fountain that springeth in a golden basin
The sound of a thousand tears, like softly pattering wings
The sound of the sea waxed
The sound of your running feet that like the sea-hoofs beat
The soundness of this doctrine depends
The spacious leisure of the forest
The speaker drew an indignant breath
The spear-tongued lightning slipped like a snake
The spell of a deathless dream was upon them
The springs of human action
The stacks of corn in brown array, like tattered wigwams on the plain
The staple of conversation
The star-strewn spaces of the night
The stars come down and trembling glow like blossoms on the waves below
The stars lay on the lapis-lazuli sky
The stars looked down in their silent splendor
The stars pale and silent as a seer
The stars seemed attentive
The steadfast mind kept its hope
The steady thunder of the sea accented the silence
The still voice of the poet
The stillness of a forced composure
The stillness of finality
The stillness of the star-hung night
The stings of self-reproach
The story seems to me incredible
The straightforward path of inexorable logic
The strange cold sense of aloofness that had numbed her senses
The strangest thought shimmered through her
The stream forgot to smile
The streams laughed to themselves
The strident discord seemed to mock his mood
The strong hand of executive authority
The strongest proof I have
The stunning crash of the ocean saluted her
The subject is extremely interesting
The subject of the evening's address
The subject which has been assigned to me
The subtle emanation of other influences seemed to arrest and chill him
The sudden rush of the awakened mind
The sudden thought of your face is like a wound when it comes unsought
The sum and fruit of experience
The sum total of her impressions was negative
The summit of excellence
The summit of human attainment
The sun blazed torridly
The sun goes down in flame on the far horizon
The sun lay golden-soft over the huddled hills
The sun on the sea-wave lies white as the moon
The sun, like a great dragon, writhes in gold
The sunlight spread at a gallop along the hillside
The sunset was rushing to its height
The supernatural prescience of prophecy
The surf was like the advancing lines of an unknown enemy
The suspicion of secret malevolence
The sweet indulgence of good-nature
The swelling tide of memory
The swing of the pendulum through an arch of centuries
The sycophants of the rich
The taint of fretful ingratitude
The talk flowed
The target for ill-informed criticism
The task has been placed in my hands
The tears welled up and flowed abundantly
The tediousness of inactivity
The tempered daylight of an olive garden
The tendency to evade implicit obligations
The tender grace of a day that is fled
The tension of struggling tears which strove for an outlet
The terrible past lay afar, like a dream left behind in the night
The testimony of history is
The theory seems at first sight
The thought leaped
The thought with which I shall close
The tide was in the salt-weed, and like a knife it tore
The ties of a common cause
The time has manifestly now arrived
The time is not far distant
The time is now come for me
The time, gliding like a dream
The timely effusion of tearful sentiment
The times are full of signs and warnings
The toast I am about to propose to you
The tone betrayed a curious irritation
The tone of it was certainly hostile
The torrent from the hills
The torture of his love and terror crushed him
The tranquil aspects of society
The tree whose plumed boughs are soft as wings of birds
The trees rustled and whispered to the streams
The tribute of affectionate applause
The tumult in her heart subsided
The tumult in her mind found sudden speech
The tumult of pride and pleasure
The tune of moving feet in the lamplit city
The tyranny of nipping winds and early frosts
The ultimate verdict of mankind
The unbroken habit of a lifetime
The unimpeachable correctness of his demeanor
The unlicensed indulgence of curiosity
The unmasked batteries of her glorious gray eyes
The unsophisticated period of youth
The uproar and contention pierced him like arrows
The utmost excitement and agitation
The vacant fields looked blankly irresponsive
The vain wish has sometimes been indulged
The vanishing thoughtlessness of youth
The vanity and conceit of insular self-satisfaction
The vast and shadowy stream of time
The vast cathedral of the world
The vast unexplored land of dreams
The veiled future bowed before me like a vision of promise
The velvet grass that is like padding to earth's meager ribs
The velvet of the cloudless sky grew darker, and the stars more luminous
The veneer of a spurious civilization
The very obvious moral is this
The very pulsation and throbbing of his intellect
The very silence of the place appeared a source of peril
The very texture of man's soul and life
The victim of an increasing irritability
The victorious assertion of personality
The view I have been enforcing
The view is more misleading
The villa dips its foot in the lake, smiling at its reflection
The virtue of taciturnity     
The vision fled him
The vivifying touch of humor
The voice of Fate, crying like some old Bellman through the world
The voice that rang in the night like a bugle call
The voice was sharp and peremptory
The want of serious and sustained thinking
The warm kindling blood burned her cheeks like the breath of a hot wind
The warmth and kindness of your reception
The waves were rolling in, long and lazy, like sea-worn travelers
The web of lies is rent in pieces
The welcome that has been extended to me
The wheel of her thought turned in the same desolate groove
The whispering rumble of the ocean
The white seething surf fell exhausted along the shore
The whole exquisite night was his
The whole sea of foliage is shaken and broken up
The whole story of civilization
The whole thing is an idle fancy
The whole truth, naked, cold, and fatal as a patriot's blade
The wide horizon forever flames with summer
The widest compass of human life
The wild whirl of nameless regret and passionate sorrow
The wild winds flew round, sobbing in their dismay
The wind all round their ears hissed like a flight of white-winged geese
The wind charged furiously through it, panting towards the downs
The wind comes and it draws its length along
The wind piped drearily
The wind was in high frolic with the rain
The wine flows like blood
The winnowed tastes of the ages
The woman seemed like a thing of stone
The wonderful pageant of consciousness
The woods were silent with adoration
The words kept ringing in my ears like the tolling of a bell
The words of the wise fall
The words stabbed him
The world had vanished like a phantasmagoria
The world is bitter as a tear
The world is in a simmer, like a sea
The world wavers within its circle like a dream
The years stretched before her like some vast blank page
The years vanished like a May snowdrift
The yellow apples glowed like fire
The youth of the soul
The zenith turned shell pink
Their authenticity may be greatly questioned
Their ephemeral but enchanting beauty had expired forever
Their eyes met glancingly
Their glances met like crossed swords
Their indignation waxed fast and furious
Their joy like sunshine deep and broad falls on my heart
Their minds rested upon the thought,
Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss
Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting
Their troth had been plighted
Themes of perennial interest
Then I have your permission?
Then again, in corroboration
Then again, when men say
Then fall unheeded like the faded flower
Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
Then it swelled out to rich and glorious harmonies
Then take the other side of the argument
Then the lover sighing like furnace
Then the question arises
Then there is another story
Then you merely want to ask my advice?
Then you're really not disinclined?
Then, too, it must be remembered
Theories sprouted in his mind like mushrooms
There are certain old truths
There are endless difficulties
There are few spectacles
There are hopeful signs of
There are many educated and intelligent people
There are people in every community
There are reasons which make such a course impossible
There are several reasons why
There are some slight modifications
There are some who are fond of looking at
There are some who have an idea
There are those of us who can remember
There are those who wish
There are two conflicting theories
There are, I believe, many who think
There are, indeed, exceptions
There are, indeed, persons who profess
There can be but one answer
There can be no doubt
There has been a great deal of discussion lately
There has been no period of time
There have been differences of opinion
There is a characteristic saying
There is a class of person
There is a common saying
There is a conviction
There is a degree of evidence
There is a genuine grief
There is a good deal of sense in that
There is a grain of truth in that, I admit
There is a great deal of rash talking
There is a growing disposition
There is a large class of thinkers
There is a lesson of profound interest
There is a more important question
There is a most serious lesson
There is a multitude of facts
There is a question of vital importance
There is a very common tendency
There is a vital difference of opinion
There is an air about you like the air that folds a star
There is an analogy in this respect
There is an ancient story to the effect
There is an eternal controversy
There is another class of men
There is another factor
There is another object equally important
There is another point of view
There is another remarkable analogy
There is another sense in which
There is but one consideration
There is certainly no reason
There is food for reflection in that
There is hardly any limit
There is little truth in
There is my hand on it
There is no field of human activity
There is no good reason
There is no justification for
There is no mistaking the purpose
There is no more insidious peril
There is no more striking exemplification
There is no occasion to exaggerate
There is no page of history
There is no resisting you
There is no sense in saying
There is no worse perversion
There is not a shadow of evidence
There is nothing I should like so much
There is nothing more repulsive
There is nothing overstated in this description
There is nothing to show
There is one inevitable condition
There is one story which it is said
There is only one sense in which
There is some difference of opinion
There is something almost terrifying about it
There is something strangely interesting
There is yet another distinction
There is yet one other remark
There is, at any rate, to be said
There is, however, another opinion
There is, however, one caution
There must be extenuating circumstances
There ought certainly to be
There seemed to brood in the air a quiet benevolence
There she soars like a seraph
There she stood straight as a lily on its stem
There slowly rose to sight, a country like a dragon fast asleep
There streamed into the air the sweet smell of crushed grass, as though
There was a blank silence
There was a kind of exhilaration in this subtle baiting
There was a mild triumph in her tone
There was a mournful and dim haze around the moon
There was a strange massing and curving of the clouds
There was a thrill in the air
There was a time I might have trod the sunlit heights
There was but one alternative
There was no glint of hope anywhere
There was no menace in the night's silvern calmness
There was no sense of diminution
There was one remarkable incident
There was something so kindly in its easy candor
There was spendthrift grandeur
There will always be a number of men
There will be no difficulty
There yet remains
There, like a bird, it sits and sings
Therefore we are able to make you this offer
Therefore we trust you will write to us promptly
Therefore, there is no possibility of a doubt
Therein lies your responsibility
These alone would not be sufficient
These are enough to refute the opinion
These are general counsels
These are generalizations
These are my reasons for
These are points for consideration
These considerations have great weight with me
These exceptions do not hold in the case of
These eyes like stars have led me
These final words snapped like a whip-lash
These ideas naturally present themselves
These instances are far from common
These instances are indications
These last words lead me to say
These objections only go to show
These points should be most carefully considered
These qualities were raised to the white heat of enthusiasm
These questions I shall examine
These thoughts pierced me like thorns
These various partial views
They affected the tone of an impartial observer
They amuse me immensely
They are as cruel as creeping tigers
They are as white foam on the swept sands
They are as white swans in the dusk, thy white hands
They are painted sharp as death
They became increasingly turbid and phantasmagorical
They broke into pieces and fell on the ground,
They dropped like panthers
They escaped the baffled eye
They fly like spray
They had hands like claws
They had slipped away like visions
They have as many principles as a fish has bones
They have faces like flowers
They hurried down like plovers that have heard the call
They look like rose-buds filled with snow
They mistake the intelligence
They rent the air with shouts and acclamations
They seem like swarming flies, the crowd of little men
They seemed like floating flowers
They shine as sweet as simple doves
They sit heavy on the soul
They stand like solitary mountain forms
They vanished like the shapes that float upon a summer's dream
They were vastly dissimilar
They would persuade you to
Thick as wind-blown leaves innumerable
Thickly the flakes drive past, each like a childish ghost
Thine eyes like two twin stars shining
Think for a moment
Think of the cool disregard
This I conceive to be the business
This I consider to be my own case
This I have told you
This absurdity arises
This appeal to the common sense
This argument is especially cogent     
This arrangement will help us over the present difficulty
This being the case
This being true
This being undeniable, it is plain
This being understood, I ask
This brings me to a single remark
This brings us to a subject
This episode goes to prove
This exquisite conjunction and balance
This fact was soon made manifest
This from the nature of the case
This is a general statement
This is a most unexpected pleasure
This is a very one-sided conception
This is a very serious situation
This is according to our discussion
This is an astonishing announcement
This is charmingly new to me
This is conceded by
This is contrary to all argument
This is doubtless the truth
This is especially the case
This is essentially an age of
This is in the main just
This is indeed good fortune
This is like saying
This is not all
This is not the main point of objection
This is not the occasion or the place
This is obvious
This is on the whole reasonable
This is only another illustration of
This is owing in great measure to
This is precisely what we ought to do
This is really appalling
This is really not a laughing matter
This is said in no spirit of
This is suggested to us
This is the design and intention
This is the great fact
This is the main point on which the inquiry turns
This is the meaning of
This is the obvious answer
This is the point I want to impress upon you
This is the point of view
This is the position of our minds
This is the radical question
This is the sentiment of mankind
This is the starting-point
This is the sum
This is to be found in the fact
This is what I am led to say
This is what may be objected
This is why I take the liberty
This language is plain
This leads me to the question
This leads us to inquire
This life is like a bubble blown up in the air
This little independent thread of inquiry
This love that dwells like moonlight in your face
This matter has been considered very seriously
This may be said without prejudice
This might be illustrated at length
This much is certain
This personal guarantee I look upon as a service to you
This privileged communication is for the exclusive use
This sentiment was well-nigh universal
This shadowy and chilling sentiment unaccountably creeps over me
This thought is as death
This tower rose in the sunset like a prayer
This will amply repay you
This will be evident at once
This you can not deny
This, at least, is sure
This, surely, is the conclusion
This, then, is the answer
This, then, is the drift of my illustration
This, then, is what I mean by saying
Those ancestral themes past which so many generations have slept
Those are my own private feelings
Those death-like eyes, unconscious of the sun
Those eyelids folded like a white rose-leaf
Those eyes like bridal beacons shine
Those things are not forgotten at once
Those who have watched the tendencies
Thou art to me but as a wave of the wild sea
Thou as heaven art fair and young
Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea
Thou must wither like a rose
Thou shalt be as free as mountain winds
Thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood
Though bright as silver the meridian beams shine
Though thou be black as night
Thought shook through her in poignant pictures
Thoughts came thronging in panic haste
Thoughts vague as the fitful breeze
Thoughts which mock at human life
Three-cornered notes fly about like butterflies
Thrilled by fresh and indescribable odors
Thrilled to the depths of her being
Thrilled with a sense of strange adventure
Through a cycle of many ages
Through endless and labyrinthine sentences
Through ever-widening circles of devastation
Through the distortions of prejudice
Through the forest, like a fairy dream through some dark mind,
Through the moonlit trees, like ghosts of sounds haunting the moonlight,
Through the riot of his senses, like a silver blaze, ran the legend
Thus I am led on to another remark
Thus a great deal may be done
Thus analogy suggests
Thus far, I willingly admit
Thus if you look into
Thus instances occur now and then
Thus it comes to pass
Thus much I may be allowed to say
Thus much may be sufficient to recall
Thus much, however, I may say
Thus my imagination tells me
Thus we see
Thwarted by seeming insuperable obstacles
Thy beauty like a beast it bites
Thy brown benignant eyes have sudden gleams of gladness and surprise,
Thy carven columns must have grown by magic, like a dream in stone
Thy favors are but like the wind that kisses everything it meets
Thy heart is light as a leaf of a tree
Thy name burns like a gray and flickering candle flame
Thy name will be as honey on men's lips
Till death like sleep might steal on me
Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven
Time drops in decay, like a candle burnt out
Time had passed unseen
Time like a pulse shakes fierce
Time was dissolving the circle of his friends
Time would not permit me
Times of unexampled difficulty
Tinsel glitter of empty titles
Tinseled over with a gaudy embellishment of words
Tired with a dull listless fatigue
To a man of the highest public spirit
To a practised eye
To all intents and purposes
To avoid all possibility of being misunderstood
To be more explicit
To be sedulously avoided             
To be sure, we sometimes hear
To bring the matter nearer home
To convince them of this
To drag life on, which
To feel the true force of this argument
To forsake as the trees drop their leaves in autumn
To illustrate
To make my story quite complete
To me it's simply outrageous
To me, however, it would appear
To my way of conceiving such matters
To prevent misapprehension
To prosecute a scheme of personal ambition
To some it may sound like a paradox
To speak frankly, I do not like it
To speak with entire candor
To state the case is to prove it
To stay his tottering constancy
To sum up all that has been said
To sum up in one word
To take a very different instance
To the conclusion thus drawn
To the enormous majority of persons
To the scourging he submitted with a good grace
To these general considerations
To this I answer
To this it will be replied
To what other cause can you ascribe
To-day, as never before
Too preposterous for belief
Too puerile to notice
Too sanguine a forecast   
Torn asunder by eternal strife
Tossed disdainfully off from young and ardent lips
Totally detached from all factions
Touched every moment with shifting and enchanting beauty
Touched with a bewildering and elusive beauty
Touched with a sort of reverential gratitude
Toys with smooth trifles like a child at play
Transcend the bounds of human credulity
Transcendental contempt for money
Transformed with an overmastering passion
Transitory as clouds without substance
Transitory in its nature
Transparent and ridiculous self-importance
Transparent like a shining sun
Treading close upon the heels
Treasured up with a timid and niggardly thrift
Treated the idea with lofty scorn
Tree and shrub altered their values
Trees that spread their forked boughs like a stag's antlers
Trembling like an aspen-leaf
Tremendous exploits and thrilling escapades
Tried by this standard
Trouble gathered on his brow
True incentives to knowledge
True it is
True, I forgot!
True, there are difficulties
Truly it is a subject for astonishment
Trusting that we may have the pleasure of serving you
Trusting to receive your best consideration
Truths which forever shine as fixed stars
Turning easily and securely as on a perfect axle
Turning the world topsy-turvey
Twilight creeps upon the darkening mind
Two things are made very clear
Unamiable and envious attributes
Unapproachable grandeur and simplicity
Unaware of her bitter taunt
Unbends like a loosened bow
Unbounded devotion and indulgence
Unbreakable as iron
Uncharted oceans of thought
Unconquerable fidelity to duty
Unconscious as an oak-tree of its growth
Undeniably true
Under all conceivable circumstances
Under all the circumstances
Under no circumstances can we entertain such an arrangement
Under separate cover we are mailing to you
Under the sway of arbitrary opinions
Under the vivifying touch of genius
Under the willow-tree glimmered her face
Under these circumstances we are willing to extend the terms
Under these favoring conditions
Under this head
Undertaken under propitious circumstances
Undoubtedly we may find
Unearthly in its malignant glee
Uneasy sense of impending change
Unequaled simplicity and directness of purpose
Unexceptional in point of breeding
Unexpected obstacles and inextricable difficulties
Unfailing and miraculous foresight
Unfathomed depths and impossibilities
Unfeigned astonishment and indignation
Unforced and unstudied depth of feeling
Unfortunately I must decline the proposal
Unfortunately it is a truth
Unfortunately we are compelled at certain times
Unfounded and incredible calumnies
Unhampered by binding alliances
Unheralded, like some tornado
Universal in their signification
Unjust and unrighteous persecution
Unknown, like a seed in fallow ground, was the germ of a plan
Unless I could be sure
Unless you can give us reasonable assurance
Unlikely to be so
Unmoving as a tombstone
Unquestionably superior
Unreasoning and unquestioning attachment
Unrivaled beauty and excellence
Unrivaled gift of succinct and trenchant speech
Unsparing industry and attention
Unspeakably alluring and satisfying
Unspoiled by praise or blame
Unspoken messages from some vaster world
Unstable moral equilibrium of boyhood
Unsurpassed in force and fitness
Unswerving and unselfish fidelity
Untameable as flies
Until sleep overtakes us at a stride
Untiring enunciation of platitudes and fallacies
Untouched by the ruthless spirit of improvement
Unutterable things pressing on my soul
Unutterably trivial and paltry
Unwavering and unquestioning approbation
Unwholesome influence, I would say
Unworthy and ungenerous treatment
Up to this moment I have stated
Upbraid ourselves with folly
Upcast like foam of the effacing tide
Uplifting the soul as on dovelike wings
Uplifting their stony peaks around us
Upon being advised that these terms are satisfactory
Upon receiving your letter of
Upon the mountain-tops of meditation
Urbanely plastic and versatile
Urgent as the seas
Urgent warning and admonition
Uttering grandiose puerilities     
Uttering wild cries like a creature in pain
Utterly and essentially irreverent
Vague as a dream
Vague thoughts that stream shapelessly through her mind
Vain allurements of folly and fashion
Vanish into thin air, like ghosts at the cockcrow
Vanished like snow when comes a thaw
Vanished like vapor before the sun
Variously ramified and delicately minute channels of expression
Varnished over with a cold repellent cynicism
Vast and vague aspirations
Vast sweep of mellow distances
Vastly complex and far-reaching problems
Vehemently and indignantly repudiated
Veiled by some equivocation
Venerable and dignified conservatism
Versatile and essentially original
Versed in the arts of exciting tumult and sedition
Very good, I'll do so
Very strange is this indeed
Very well, I will consent
Vibrant with the surge of human passions
Vibrations set quivering like harp strings struck by the hand of a master
Vicissitudes of wind and weather
Viewed in its general tenor and substance
Vigor and richness of resource
Vigorous and well compacted
Violating all decency
Violent and unforeseen vicissitudes
Virtually accomplished, I believe
Visible and palpable pains and penalties
Vitiated by intolerance and shortsightedness
Vivacity is her greatest charm
Vivid even to oppressiveness
Vociferous praise following like a noisy wave
Voices that charm the ear and echo with a subtle resonance in the soul
Volcanic upheavings of imprisoned passions
Voracious and insatiable appetite
Vouch for its truth
Vulgar eagerness for place
Walking somewhat unsteadily like a blind man feeling his way
Wantonly and detestably unkind
Warnings too pregnant to be disregarded
Warped by personal pretensions and self-consequence
Waves glittered and danced on all sides like millions of diamonds
Waylay Destiny and bid him stand and deliver
Wayward and strangely playful responses
We acknowledge with pleasure the receipt of your order
We admit that you are justified in your complaint
We again solicit an opportunity
We again thank you for your inquiry

We are beginning to realize
We are bound to give heed
We are confident that you will have no further trouble
We are constantly being told
We are drifting away from our point
We are extremely desirous of pleasing our patrons
We are fulfilling what I believe to be
We are impervious to certain rules
We are in a position to give you considerable help
We are in receipt of your communication regarding
We are in the habit of saying
We are indeed sorry to learn
We are merely wasting energy in this duel
We are met to-night
We are not able to prove
We are not disinterested
We are perfectly willing to make concessions
We are pleased to receive your request for information
We are pleased to send you descriptive circulars
We are quite unable to speculate

We believe that if you will carefully consider the matter
We believe with a sincere belief
We believe you will readily understand our position
We can assure you that any order with which you favor us
We can but pause to contemplate
We can imagine the amazement of
We can not but be struck with
We can not escape the truth
We can not have this too deeply fixed
We can not too highly honor the temper of
We can not wonder
We can only applaud the sentiment
We can only bow with awe
We can presume
We can remember with pride
We can safely take it for granted
We can see to some extent
We continually hear nowadays
We couldn't have a better topic
We deeply appreciate the circumstances of
We desire information pertaining to your financial condition
We desire to effect a settlement
We desire to express our appreciation of your patronage
We desire to impress upon you
We do not quarrel with those
We do not question the reality
We do well to recall
We easily persuade ourselves
We expect to be in the market soon
We feel assured that you will appreciate
We feel keenly about such things
We feel sure that you will approve of our action in this matter
We frankly apologize to you
We grope blindly along
We had better agree to differ
We hasten to acknowledge the receipt
We have a firm assurance
We have a right to claim
We have an overpowering sense
We have anticipated a heavy demand
We have been accustomed to
We have been told by more than one
We have come to the conclusion
We have come together to-night
We have endeavored to serve the needs of your organization
We have found it impossible
We have great reason to be thankful
We have had some conclusions in common
We have heard lately
We have here plain proof
We have much pleasure in answering your inquiry
We have need to examine
We have no desire to adopt harsh measures
We have no means of knowing
We have no other alternative
We have not had the pleasure of placing your name on our ledgers
We have not yet had time to sift the matter thoroughly
We have not yet solved the problem
We have not, however, had the pleasure of hearing from you
We have sought on this occasion
We have the evidence of this
We have the good fortune to-night
We have the honor to be, gentlemen
We have the honor to inform you
We have thought it best to forward
We have to admit
We have witnessed on many occasions
We have your request for information regarding
We have, as yet, no definite understanding
We hear it is said sometimes
We hear no complaint
We heartily wish and mean
We hesitated for a while to pursue the matter
We hold fast to the principle
We hope that an understanding can be reached
We hope that we shall have many opportunities to demonstrate our ability
We hope that you will find the enclosed booklet very interesting
We hope to hear favorably from you
We hope you will appreciate
We hope you will excuse the unavoidable delay
We invite your attention to
We laugh to scorn the idea
We left her and retraced our steps like faithless hounds
We may all of us agree
We may be permitted to remember
We may contemplate with satisfaction
We may have a deep consciousness
We may indeed consider
We may not know precisely how
We may parenthetically note
We must also look
We must constantly direct our purpose
We must insist upon a prompt settlement
We must judge it leniently
We must not be deceived
We must not expose ourselves to misinterpretation
We must not mistake
We must profoundly revere it
We must realize conscientiously
We must remember
We must, therefore, insist on the terms of the agreement
We need no proof to assure us
We need not look far for reasons
We need not trouble ourselves
We note that the time is at hand
We of this generation
We offer you the services of an expert
We often hear persons say
We ought in strict propriety
We owe you a debt of gratitude
We particularly want to interest you
We pride ourselves upon the fact
We realize that this is simply an oversight on your part
We realize that this matter has escaped your attention
We regret exceedingly that you have been inconvenienced
We regret our inability to meet your wishes
We regret that owing to the press of business
We regret that this misunderstanding has occurred
We regret that we are not in a position
We regret that we are unable to grant your request

We regret to be compelled for this reason to withdraw the privilege
We regret to learn that you are disappointed
We remain, dear sir, yours faithfully
We remain, gentlemen, with thanks

We should dread nothing so much
We should lend our influence
We should not question for a moment
We should not, therefore, question
We stand astonished at
We stumble and falter and fall
We suggest that this is an opportune time
We suggest that you consider
We take it for granted
We take pleasure in enclosing herewith
We take pleasure in explaining the matter you asked about
We take the liberty of deviating from your instructions
We take the liberty of writing to you.

We want every opportunity to demonstrate our willingness
We want particularly to impress upon you this fact
We want to please you in every respect
We want to remind you again
We want you to read the booklet carefully
We will at once enter your order
We will be compelled to take the necessary steps
We will be glad to lay before you the fullest details
We will be pleased to give it careful consideration
We will devoutly hope not
We will gladly accommodate you
We will gladly extend to you similar courtesies whenever we can do so
We will make it a point to give your correspondence close attention
We will not stop to inquire
We would appreciate a remittance
We would consider it a great favor
We would draw your attention to the fact
We would request, as a special favor
We write to suggest to you
We write to urge upon you the necessity
We wrote to you at length
Weak and frail like the vapor of a vale
Wearing the white flower of a blameless life
Wearing their wounds like stars
Weary wind, who wanderest like the world's rejected guest
Weigh the merits and demerits
Weighty as these conditions are
Welcomed at first with skeptical contempt
Well done! I congratulate you
Well may we explain
Well, I call it scandalous
Well, I confess they don't appeal to me
Well, I'm not going to argue that
Well, as a matter of fact, I have forgotten
Well, gentlemen, it must be confessed
Well, more's the pity
Well, now, let us propose
Well, perhaps it is none of my affair
Well, that being the case, I say
Well, that is certainly ideal!
Well, this is good fortune
Well, yes--in a way
Well, you are a dreamer!
Well-concerted and well-timed stratagems
Were I to enter into a detailed description
Were I to speculate
What I mean is this
What I now say is
What I object to is
What I propose to do is
What I shall actually attempt to show here
What I suggest is
What a beautiful idea
What a charming place you have here
What a curious coincidence!
What a pretty compliment!
What a tempting prospect!
What an extraordinary idea!
What are the precise characteristics
What are we to think of
What are you going to do
What are your misgivings?
What can I say better
What can avail
What can be more intelligible
What can be more monstrous than
What can you possibly mean?
What commonly happens is this
What conceivable reason is there for it?
What could be more captivating
What could be more true
What do we gain by
What do we understand to have been
What do you imagine my course should be?
What do you propose?
What is more important
What is more remarkable
What is the next step in your argument?
What is the pretext
What is there so strange about that?
What is this but to say
What more shall I say
What remains but to wish you
What sorry and pitiful quibbling
What strikes the mind so forcibly
What unseemly levity on his part
What very kind things you say to me
What was the consequence of
What we are concerned to know is
What we have most to complain of
What would you expect me to do?
What would you say
What you have just said is even truer than you realize
What you propose is utterly impossible
What, may I ask, is your immediate object?
What, then, I may be asked
What, then, are we to believe
What, then, can be the reason
What, then, is the use
What, then, was the nature of
Whatever a man thinks
Whatever difference of opinion may exist
Whatever opinion I may express
Whatever the truth may be
When I am told
When I hear it said
When I remember the history
When I review these circumstances
When I speak of this question
When I thus profess myself
When a draft might puff them out like a guttering candle
When a pleasant countryside tunes the spirit to a serene harmony of mood
When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,
When cards, invitations, and three-corn'd notes
When music is allied to words
When one remembers
When she died, her breath whistled like the wind in a keyhole
When the fever pierced me like a knife
When the frame and the mind alike seem unstrung and listless
When the profane voices are hushed
When the waves show their teeth in the flying breeze
When we consider the vastness
When we contemplate
When we get so far as this
When we look closely at
When will men understand
When you are assured
When you did me the honor to invite me
Whence it is, I say
Whence was the proof to come
Where a lamp of deathless beauty shines like a beacon
Where heroes die as leaves fall
Where the intricate wheels of trade are grinding on, like a mill
Where the source of the waters is fine as a thread
While I feel most keenly the honor
While I have hinted to you
While acknowledging the great value
While we appreciate the peculiar circumstances
While we feel that we are in no way responsible
Whilst I am on this matter
Whilst the lagging hours of the day went by
Whilst the morn kissed the sleep from her eyes
Whirled into rapid and ceaseless motion
Whistled life away in perfect contentment
Whistled sharply in the air like a handful of vipers
White as a ghost from darkness
White as chalk
White as dove or lily, or spirit of the light
White as the driven snow
White as the moon's white flame
White as the sea-bird's wing
White clouds like daisies
White hands she moves like swimming swans
White hands through her hair,
White like flame
White sails of sloops like specters
Who can deny the effect
Who can say in a word
Who does not like to see
Who has not felt the contrast
Who is your sagacious adviser?       
Who that reads does not see
Who will accuse me
Wholesale friction and discontent
Wholly alien to his spirit
Wholly devoid of public interest
Whose bodies are as strong as alabaster
Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king
Whose laugh moves like a bat through silent haunted woods
Whose little eyes glow like the sparks of fire
Whose music like a robe of living light reclothed each new-born age
Why ask such embarrassing questions?
Why did you desert us so entirely?
Why do you take it so seriously?
Why need you seek to disprove
Why not allow us this opportunity to satisfy you
Why, again, should I take notice
Widely divergent social traits
Wield an unequaled and paramount authority
Will any gentleman say
Will anyone answer
Will it be whispered
Will it not be well for us
Will you allow me to ask you a question?
Will you allow me to present to you
Will you be more explicit?
Will you bear with me
Will you give us the benefit of your experience
Will you give us, in confidence, your opinion
Will you have the kindness to explain?
Will you kindly advise us in order that we may adjust our records
Will you mistake this
Will you pardon my curiosity?
Will you permit me a brief explanation?
Will you permit me to thank you
Will you please give us your immediate attention
Windy speech which hits all around the mark like a drunken carpenter
Winged like an arrow to its mark
Wiser counsels prevailed
With a sting like a scorpion
With a vanquished and weary sigh
With all my heart I share
With all the complacency of a homeless cat
With an angry broken roar, like billows on an unseen shore, their fury burst
With hate darkling as the swift winter hail
With music sweet as love
With our best respects and hoping to hear from you
With possibly a single exception
With reference to your favor of yesterday
With regard to your inquiry
With respect to what has been said
With sounds like breakers
With strength like steel
With the fullest assurance that we are considering
With the greatest esteem and respect
With the whisper of leaves in one's ear
With this ideal clearly before us
With whatever opinions we come here
With words like honey melting from the comb
Withal decidedly handsome
Without going into any details
Without my saying a word more
Wits as sharp as gimlets     
Womanly fickleness and caprice
Women with tongues like polar needles
Words and acts easily wrenched from their true significance
Words as fresh as spring verdure
Words as soft as rain
Words like the gossamer film of the summer
Words sweet as honey from his lips distill'd
Words were flashing like brilliant birds through the boughs overhead
Wordsworth, thy music like a river rolls
Worn to shreds by anxiety
Worthless like the conjurer's gold
Would you apply that to everyone?
Would you mind telling me your opinion?
Wrangle over details like a grasping pawnbroker
Wrapped in a sudden intensity of reflection
Wrapped in an inaccessible mood
Wrapped in scudding rain
Wrapt in his odorous and many-colored robe
Wrapt in inward contemplation
Wrinkled and scored like a dried apple
Writhing with an intensity that burnt like a steady flame
Written in indelible characters upon his heart
Wrought of an emotion infectious and splendidly dangerous
Wrought out of intense and tragic experience
Yes and no
Yes, I dare say
Yes, but that is just what I fail to comprehend
Yes, if you will be so good
Yes, it was extraordinarily fine
Yes, that is my earnest wish
Yes, that's undeniable
Yes? You were saying?
Yet I am convinced
Yet I am willing to admit
Yet I am willing to conclude
Yet I feel quite free to say
Yet I have never been thoroughly satisfied
Yet I suppose it is worth while
Yet I would have to think
Yet I, for one, do not hesitate to admit
Yet if you were to ask the question
Yet it is instructive and interesting
Yet it is no less true
Yet it is perfectly plain
Yet let me consider what consequences must
Yet may I not remind you
Yield to urgent representations
Yielding like melted snow
Yielding to a wave of pity
Yonder flimsy crescent, bent like an archer's bow above the snowy summit
You agree with me, I know
You all know the history of
You and I are always contrasting
You are a profound philosopher
You are a severe critic
You are as gloomy to-night as an undertaker out of employment
You are as hard as stone
You are at a parting of the ways
You are certainly justified in complaining
You are delightfully frank
You are evidently aware that there is a growing demand
You are greatly to be envied
You are heartily welcome
You are incomprehensible
You are incorrigible
You are kind and comforting
You are most kind
You are not consistent
You are not serious, I hope
You are not seriously displeased with me?
You are now invited to do honor
You are quite delightful
You are quite right in your statement
You are rather puzzling to-day
You are right to remind me of that
You are unduly distressing yourself
You are very complimentary
You are very gracious
You ask me--but I shouldn't wonder if you knew better than I do
You astonish me greatly
You behaved with great forbearance
You can hardly be serious
You can never forget
You can not assert
You cannot regret it more than I do
You cannot regret more than I the necessity
You could not pay me a higher compliment
You did it excellently
You did not clearly understand what I meant
You do not need to be told
You don't seem very enthusiastic
You excite my curiosity
You flatter my judgment
You gave me such chill embraces
You have a genius for saying the right thing
You have all read the story
You have asked me a riddle
You have asked the impossible
You have been gracious enough to assign to me
You have been mindful
You have been pleased to confer upon me
You have been wrongly informed
You have but to observe
You have done me a great service
You have done me great honor
You have had a pleasant time, I hope
You have my deepest sympathy
You have my unbounded confidence
You have no right
You have not forgotten
You have often pondered over
You have received a false impression
You have sometimes been astonished
You have such an interesting way of putting things
You interest me deeply
You judge yourself too severely
You know I'm in an agony of curiosity
You know I'm not given to sentimentality
You know that it is impossible to
You know the familiar axiom
You know the legend which has grown up
You know very well
You leave no alternative
You look incredulous
You may also be assured
You may be acquainted with
You may be sure
You may be sure of my confidence
You may depend upon it
You may rely on me absolutely
You may remember
You may well be proud
You may well study the example
You might apply to yourselves
You might make an exception
You must have misunderstood me
You must not fail to command me
You must not forget
You must understand I do not mean to claim
You ought not to disregard what I say
You overwhelm me with your kindness
You really insist upon it?
You rebuke me very fairly
You remember how
You say that as though you were surprised
You see how widely we differ
You see things rose-colored
You see, it's all very vague
You seem to be in a happy mood
You seem to take a very mild interest in what I propose
You shock me more than I can say
You speak in enigmas
You speak with authority
You surely understand my position
You take a great deal for granted
You take a pessimistic view of things
You take me quite by surprise
You undoubtedly are aware
You will admit I have some provocation
You will allow me to say with becoming brevity
You will be pleased to hear
You will bear me out when I say
You will become morbid if you are not careful
You will clearly understand
You will expect me to say something about
You will find interest, we believe, in this advance announcement
You will forgive me
You will get the benefit of this liberal offer
You will have ample opportunity
You will have particular interest in the new and attractive policy
You will join with me, I trust
You will observe
You will pardon me, I am sure
You will please not be flippant
You will scarcely be surprised
You will understand my anxiety
You will, of course, remember the incident
You would never dream of urging
You yourselves are the evidence
You're so tremendously kind about it
You're succeeding admirably
You're taking it all much too seriously
You're talking nonsense!
You're very good, I'm sure
Your argument is facile and superficial
Your blood is red like wine
Your charms lay like metals in a mine
Your consideration is entirely misplaced
Your early attention to this matter will oblige
Your eyes are like fantastic moons that shiver in some stagnant lake
Your eyes as blue as violets
Your eyes they were green and gray like an April day
Your frail fancies are swallowed up,
Your friendly and generous words
Your further orders will be esteemed
Your good sense must tell you
Your hair was golden as tints of sunrise
Your heart is as dry as a reed
Your inquiry has just been received, and we are glad to send to you
Your judgments are very sound
Your locks are like the raven
Your logic is as clever as possible
Your love shall fall about me like sweet rain
Your mind enthroned in the seventh circle of content
Your opinion will be invaluable to me
Your orders and commands will always have our prompt and best attention
Your presence seems to say
Your request is granted before it is made
Your satisfaction will dictate our course
Your statement is somewhat startling
Your step's like the rain to summer vexed farmer
Your thoughts are buzzing like a swarm of bees
Your tongue is like a scarlet snake
Your trial order is respectfully solicited
Your usual attention will oblige
Your voice had a quaver in it just like the linnet

like sudden smilings of divine delight
like the flight of a million arrows
like the genii from the earthen pot
like the head and skin of a dying man
like the shimmering necks of doves
like the stretching of a sea-bird's wings
like the sweep of sun-rent clouds over a quiet landscape
like the thunder of a retreating storm
like the tolling of sweet, grave bells upon the soul
like the walls and turrets of a gigantic fortress
like those by sculptor graved for niches in a temple
like to a child o'erwearied with sweet toil
like water bubbling from a silver jar?
like white doves going into the shadow of a wood
like white flower-petals on still deep water
like windless clouds o'er a tender sky
like woodland brooks that cross a sunlit spot
